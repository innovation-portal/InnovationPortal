This allows it to do cool things like conduct light very well and continue along the same path when cut with a cutter. A strand of fiber optic cable is run from a high wattage LED to the fountain stream and this allows us to change the fountain color with a raspberry pi. So we hooked up a dance pad to the pi and wrote a simple game of simon as a demo. The fountain itself will change colors to cue the player, who will then play simon with the fountain. Here's a good video of what a well built LED laminar fountain looks like and can do. This is not our fountain, just a random youtube video: laminar fountain with LEDs!\n\nHow we built it\n\n1) Construct a laminar flow fountain (easier said than done- we tried this at a previous hackathon and BARELY got it finished in time and our first prototype demoed the concept but wasn't very impressive.)\n2) Program a Raspberry Pi (in Ruby) to read a usb dance pad and output a simon game to a high wattage LED.\n3) Attach a fiberoptic cable to the LED and feed it into the fountain flow. \n4) Bonus attachment not quite done: Laminar flow cutter mechanism built with solenoids driven by an H-bridge, also controlled by the pi. Thanks Bob!\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nTime is a big challenge for us. Access to outdoor space, though happily accommodated by openworks, nevertheless meant we had to lug a lot of equipment back and forth in and out. The classrooms in Openworks aren't really ideal for this kind of hardware project and working in multiple spaces as needed again ate away at our time.  Access to tools and driving distances to our own workshops was a big challenge because none of us are Baltimore local. Additionally, all team members struggle with various levels of developmental disabilities and/or learning disabilities that make us the chaotic but amusing bunch that we always are but make it difficult for us to complete projects on time. I think time will always be a challenge for us at this kind of hackathon because of who we are and the physically large nature of our projects. \n\nA few other challenges: Our software guy, Bradford had to become proficient with several new Ruby libraries and gems in a very short period of time, and hobbling together affordable materials for the fountain itself was a matter of creativity and improvisation that put a heavy burden on our fabricator, Paul. The actual assembly of the fountain is a challenge as we troubleshoot broken seals and broken components.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe fried zero components this year! Nothing caught on fire! The new guy is a great coder and is very proud of his first GPIO project with the pi! The high wattage LED worked on the first try! \n\nWhat we learned\n\n1) Send someone to wake up Paul every morning. Also, next year consider lojaking Paul.\n2) Plumbing is hard.\n3) Water is wet.\n4) MORE POWER\n5) Okay maybe not that much power\n\nWhat's next for Dance Pad controlled Laminar Fountain\n\nIdeally we will add 3 more fountains so that each color has it's own fountain resulting in an overall much cooler display. We also want to write more games, including a traditional DDR style dancing game that creates a really dope light and water show. We'd like to eventually create a durable and contained semi-permanent installation for something like Artscape or Light City that the public can interact with. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    rubyraspberry-pithe-entire-plumbing-section-of-lowes\n  \n\n      \n    ",

Other than the occasional escape, cattle aren't frequently seen in the area. However, cattle and beef production has a significant impact on the US economy. According to the Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Board and National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, there are more than 1 million beef producers in the United States who added more than $66 billion to the US economy in 2008.\n\nGarrett Bladow, who lives in Federal Hill, is one of those beef producers. He is a co-owner of L7 Ranch, which has over 1,500 head of cattle, and is responsible for the ranch's genetic breeding program and land sequestration efforts. The quality of L7 Ranch beef has been widely recognized. The genetic traits have been sought after and recognized by the Yorkshire Agricultural Society and the Professional Bull Riding Association, among others. Additionally, over 60 percent of the Wagyu beef exported from Japan to the United States has been bred using genetic material from the L7 Ranch.\n\nGarrett is frustrated by the current state of livestock management software. Most packages are dated, don't take advantage of newer technologies, don't allow data to be easily imported, exported, or shared, and aren't attuned to the workflow of the farmers. In addition, most don't incorporate tools to help farmers improve their herds, yields, and revenue. This is especially important since most beef producers have small operations with very thin margins and, again according to the Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Board and National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, they have the lowest income of any type of farm (in 2007 an average gross cash income of $63,000). For most farmers beef production is not their primary occupation.\n\nThis industry needs a software package that has a modern and easy-to-use interface that accounts for the fact that a lot of data needs to be collected in fast-paced, dangerous environments. It also needs to support the average farmer, who is nearly 60 years old but fairly well educated. (Almost 89 percent are high school graduates and over 20 percent have a college degree.) It also should be integrated with any RFID tracking systems used on farms.\n\nWhat it does\n\nAt the Baltimore Hackathon, a team of developers came together to explore an initial solution for managing livestock and making recommendations to improve yields. The resulting application allows for stockmen \n\n\nto upload data about their herd and add additional data throughout the lifecycle of that herd, including births and vaccinations,\nto use the inputted data to get recommendations that improve their breeding profiles and cattle production yields,\nto improve their breeding program through knowledge about birth defects and other progeny risks, and\nto understand how their herd compares to average breeding profiles. \n\n\nHow we built it\n\nMobull.farm is a native React application, so that it can be ported to mobile and web platforms. The data is stored in a Neo4j database. The two are connected via middleware driven by Node.js and Express.js. \n\nAll team members contributed to the code, although three focused on constructing and populating the data model, one person wrote the API, and one person developed the user interface.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nLearning and using new tools and libraries within a limited timeframe. \nNarrowing the scope of a large project.\nHaving only one subject matter expert and exploring a subject with a lot of nuances.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nWe learned a lot about the problem space and about the technologies we chose to use. For many of us, this was the first time using Neo4j.\nWe have an initial app.\nWe thought through the user experience & talked about how stockmen will need to use the software in unusual conditions. (For example, limited wifi, cold, dirty, dangerous.)\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nThis is a big problem with a fair number of permutations.\nNeo4j is fun.\n\n\nWhat's next for mobull\n\nThe Baltimore Hackathon project is a part of a larger idea. The overarching idea of mobull.farm is a livestock management system that integrates livestock RFID tracking tags. By combining mobile platforms and synchronized online data services with a portable and cost-effective RFID reader, the system will provide four functional components, aimed at different places in the livestock production chain:\n\n\nmanaging records (animal characteristics, vaccinations, and so on) for stockmen,\nmaximizing feed potential for stockmen and feed lot operators,\nprocessing records for meat packers and inspection agencies (USDA), and\ntracking \"pasture to table\" lifecycle for consumers.\n\n\nTo accomplish these goals the system will have to work in several scenarios including\n\n\nlivestock chute systems, which a used by stockmen to safely secure animals while they are examined, marked, or given veterinary treatment,\ntransportation systems, where loading and unloading of the livestock needs to be recorded,\nfeed delivery systems, and \nthe fields where operators check stock.\n\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    neo4jnode.jsreactexpress.js\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n        \n  \n  54.70.43.30\n\n        \n  \n  54.70.43.30\n\n        \n  \n  54.70.43.30\n\n        \n  \n  54.70.43.30\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

We wanted to eliminate those things and focus on things within walking distance that are free or low-cost, like sightseeing and museums with low-cost or free hours.\n\nWhat it does\n\nWhen you load the app, it asks for your location so it can show you points of interest in your immediate vicinity.

We then cleaned and massaged as much of the data as we could in the short amount of time we have, scraped Wikipedia for some images and text associated with each location. All in all, we have over 1100 points of interest in and around Baltimore City.\n\nThe back end is a Ruby app built with the Roda web framework. We stored our data in a Neo4j database for maximum flexibility while developing it since we didn't really know what the whole schema would look like and we didn't want to spend too much time writing migrations every time we changed our minds.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nTransforming data to remove outliers and fill in gaps took a long time and we're still not done with that. Automating this process can only get us so far and, after automating, we still need to check the data our automated process gives us for correctness.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe learned a lot about the technologies we used.\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nOpen data can be very difficult to consume due to lack of consistency\nWhen automating any sort of data gathering process, human oversight and intervention is required every step of the way to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nWhat's next for Baltimore POI\n\n\nRefine our scraping process to generate better images and information blurbs for different points\nAdd a feature to allow multiple images for a single point of interest\nContinue to clean the data so it will be more useful to others, possibly abandoning our automated scraping task and manually updating what we've got\nImprove memory efficiency by limiting points of interest to just what fits in the window\nHandle more edge cases in the app, such as when all points have been filtered from the map\nAdd features, such as getting directions to a chosen point either on the page or in your favorite navigation app\nExtract the Google Maps integration into a Ruby gem to work with the Clearwater framework\nAdd crowd-source features\nGive it a better name that took more than 5 minutes to conjure\n\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    rubyrodaclearwatergoogle-mapsgpsneo4j\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

While visiting their hackathons, we learned about some challenges they face, and were inspired to build a solution.\n\nWhat it does\n\nWe hope to deputize citizens to volunteer their time and drive through the city with the app on, recording critical data on where potholes are.\n\nHow I built it\n\nBump It Up! uses an iOS App to record y-axis Accelerometer Data which signifies the iOS device encountering \"bumps\" or potholes in the road. Once the drive is done, it sends it to a backend database where a script runs to identify the potholes. Finally, there are two outputs - a Google Maps interface and a public facing RESTful API.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nDetermining what the algorithm should be to that indicates a \"bump\" was challenging. Further, pushing the data from the iOS device to the server in a proper dictionary was strangely a challenge.\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nWe found two use cases for this project - both a Google Maps Visualizations and a public-facing RESTful API - which can be used to benefit the community.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nSpecifically, our teammate Ashton Welles - a beginner to the hacking world - learned a significant amount about web development and impressed us all with his progress. Huge shoutout to him!\n\nWhat's next for Bump It Up!\n\nWe shall see... :)\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    swiftpythonjavascript\n  \n\n      \n    ",

Originally made by Milton Bradley, and currently made by Hasbro,[1] it has been in production since 1965, the year in which the game was invented by John Spinello.\n\nThe game is a variant on the old-fashioned electrified wire loop game popular at funfairs and flammer stores around the United States. It consists of an \"operating table\", lithographed with a comic likeness of a patient (nicknamed \"Cavity Sam\") with a large red lightbulb for his nose. In the surface are a number of openings, which reveal cavities filled with fictional and humorously named ailments made of plastic. The general gameplay requires players to remove these plastic ailments with a pair of tweezers without touching the edge of the cavity opening.\n\nHOW DOES THE OPERATION GAME WORKS?\n Basically, the game works by creating a simple circuit. The battery, light, buzzer, metal edges on the body and metal tweezers are connected by wires yet the wires do not go in a full circle. ie. imagine that each part is like on a chain yet it wont work unless the chain is done up and goes in a full circle. This is called a complete circuit. To complete the circuit the metal of the tweezers must touch the metal edge of the body. This connection works the same as a switch would in a simple circuit such as turning on a light. When the circuit is complete the light and buzzer turn on from the power in the battery. However, if the circuit is not complete this can't happen.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    arduino\n  \n\n      \n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  We set out to create multiplayer snake! ...in a browser.\n\n\nInspired by Agar.io, we wanted to create a simple multiplayer game which would scale well, and allow players from anywhere to play.\nFrom a technical perspective, we wanted to get our hands dirty with Node.js and HTML5 Canvas. Our team has a diverse spread of talent, but little to no experience with Node.js or even Javascript! So it was a really good learning experience for our entire team.\n\n\nThe Challenges\n\n\nWe wanted to learn javascript and node.js so we refused to use a framework, such as phaser. We designed and wrote everything in raw vanilla javascript and node.js with the exception of the express, and socket.io node modules.\nThe real struggle came with sending, receiving, and synchronizing data between any number of clients as well as the server. All this has to happen several times a second to maintain a usable performance, without overloading our server and causing latency as more and more users join.\n\n\nThe Fun, and the Future.\n\n\nSnake is wildly simple game, but throughout development we came up with so many fun ideas and cool things we could put into this game. Multiplayer snake opens up a lot of doors.\n\n\nSome of the ideas we had:\n\n\nHaving different skins for the snakes (user customizable)\nBeing able to kill other snakes, when they die, their food is available.\nSnakes made of emojies or images, when you eat another snake, the emojies get absorbed into your snake\nInfinite world\nSpeed boosts for the snakes \nSnake decay, the rich get taxed\n\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    javascripthtmlcssnode.js\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  snakes.harishlall.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

He jokingly said \"you should control LEDs with your mind! I accepted the challenge and wanted to see if I could. \n\nI also wanted to start getting into Wearable Hardware, so I figured it would be cool to make them wearable LEDs.\n\nWhat it does\n\nYou wear the Mind Wave headset and an unconnected T-Shirt with Flora LEDs sewn into it. The color of the LEDs will vary from Green to Red depending on Relaxed (Green) or Focused (Red) your mind is.\n\nHow I built it\n\nThe headset  came with a USB RF Dongle for interfacing with a PC.  I made some hardware modifications to the RF Dongle to redirect the communications to an Adafruit Flora (Wearable Arduino). I wrote an Arduino Sketch to control the RF Dongle based on Neurosky's documented protocol [3] and a guide on their Developer Wiki [2]. The Sketch receives periodical updates from the Dongle as to the wearer's meditative and focus levels, and varies the colors of the Flora LEDs based on them. I also added a chain of 4 Adafruit Flora NeoPixels to add to the effect. All of this was sewn onto the Hackathon 2015 shirt!\n\nI did do research related hacks that some other people had done with the Mindwave headset beforehand to get an idea what I was in for. Special thanks for a wealth of information that helped make this possible. I referred to the following resources:\n[1] http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-an-EEG-hat-that-turns-your-brainwaves-into-l/\n[2] http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=arduino_tutorial\n[3] Neurosky Developer ThinkGear Serial Protocol Guide\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nNumber 1 challenge was sewing!  Sewing is hard! \n\nI ran into a lot of power related issues--because I am not using the USB on the RF Dongle, it needs to be powered from the Flora system. This plus the Flora plus 4 NeoPixels apparently was too much for the standard Flora power system.I had to to cut out 2 of the NeoPixels to get it to function again, and it is still a little flaky. Given more time, I would be looking to set up a beefier battery-based power system that could sufficiently support everything.\n\nElectrical signals emitted from the brain are very subtle and can be difficult to reliably read in noisy environments. I had to leave the DHF and do some of my work at home because there was too much activity in the air. \n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nLearning to sew!  Doing a hardware hack without [completely] destroying a $80 piece of hardware. Getting to play with wearables. Having the coolest shirt at the Hackathon! Met a bunch of cool knowledgeable people.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nI learned to sew [kind of]. Learned a bit about brain control interfaces and wearables.\n\nWhat's next for Controlling Wearable LEDs with Your Mind!\n\n1 I'd like to fix the power issues and see what else I can control with my mind, and also try to adapt what I did to more practical scenarios. There is a lot of potential for helping people with disabilities with brain control interfaces.\n\n2 I love embedded stuff and I definitely came up with some ideas I will want to try soon in the wearables arena.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    your-mind!neurosky-mindwavefloraarduinoneopixelshardwareembeddedwearables\n  \n\n      \n    ",

A heart rate monitor tracks the performers heartbeat and generates a tone that plays through a speaker embedded in the collar.

The concept of the project is simple: users (you!) feed location and appearence data of community members into our servers, and we parse the data into a graphical user interface available for use by our partnered non-profit organizations. Ideally with enough active users on any given day, the Urban Help Project can significantly streamline relief, rescue, and support efforts within the urban community.\n\nAs students at the Johns Hopkins University in the city of Baltimore, it was impossible not to acknowledge that our community was broken. It came to a point where even at our school campus we were able to recognize the same faces over and over asking for spare change outside the nearby Chipotle, or just wandering around the decrepit alleyways they were forced to call home. Having worked with local non-profits that worked to support victims of human trafficking in Baltimore city, such as The Safe House of Hope, we found that a big problem in operations for organziations such as these was simply not knowing where the people they needed to help were located! We developed the Urban Help Project to not only logistically help these local non-profit organizations, but to also promote greater community outreach, especially within our own school community. The Urban Help Project more or less requires person-to-person interaction with those that we want to help, and the hope of this is that we can work towards real community cohesian.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    htmljavascriptcssnode.jsmongodb\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

Typically, athletes are in a raft pulled by their Wingmen. Matthew wants to help his team kick across the finish line. \n\nWhat it does\n\nThe swim board will provide the support Matthew's upper body needs while allowing his lower body the freedom to kick his legs in the water. \n\nHow I built it\n\nFirst we adhered the pieces of foam together. Then waited for them to dry before we could shaping them. \nOriginally, we tried shaping the foam with a hot wire cutter. This worked well to cut of large pieces but proved difficult in developing a stream-lined shaped. Then we moved on to a planer. It made a big mess and a world of difference. To date, we have a little over one side shaped. \n\nOnce the hull is shaped, we will cut out a piece for where Matthew's body will go, then cover the entire swim board with fiberglass mat and fiberglass resin. After that cures, we will test it and make adjustments from there. \n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nWe started thinking about cutting a surfboard but realized that cutting fiberglass would not be very safe. Then we decided to build the swim board from scratch, using foam. Waiting for adhesive to dry is time consuming. Shaping the board was difficult and extremely messy (requiring A LOT of clean up time). There are multiple steps that require curing time. \n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nGetting the rectangular shape of the foam to a rounded hull shape was quite an accomplishment. \n\nWhat I learned\n\nAmber learned what a planer is and how to use one. \n\nWhat's next for Swim Board\n\nWe will continue to shape the board and add a fiberglass shell. Then we will make adjustments as needed. Hopefully, we will be able create a tutorial or a mold that more of these can be easily produced for Athletes Serving Athletes. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    foamfiberglass\n  \n\n      \n    ",

Another inspiration of this project was our Algebra 1 teacher Ms. Gooding. She motivates us to do better in math. She assists us when we need help in class, and she also does what she can to help us prosper. We highly appreciate her and the way she works with us. \n\nWhat it does\n\nOur app, The MathMagician, will improve math scores by assisting people with math skills that are challenging or skills they just can't remember. Our app doesn't give answers so people have to learn how to do the certain skill and can't work around the fact of actually completing the skill. This will improve math scores because students will have to learn how to do the skills both at trouble them and won't have to guess on quizzes/tests anymore. \n\nHow we built it\n\nWe used the MIT App Inventor to make our app. \n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nSome challenges we ran into were getting the webviewer the right size in the app. Another problem we faced was the app not responding to the commands correctly. Lastly, one of the greatest problems we faced was trying to find good enough websites to use in the webviewer so people don't have to leave the app.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe're proud of the fact that people found our app very useful and relevant. We're also proud that we overcame some of the challenges and struggles we faced. \n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned that creating apps is more about creativity and using you imagination more than its about knowing computer skills and how to use certain software. We also learned that there is no I in team. To create the app, we had to work together and cooperate in order to compromise and to successfully complete what part of the app we have.\n\nWhat's next for The MathMagician\n\nSomething we would like to do is fix some of the bugs that causes the app to work improperly and cause stress because we don't want to contribute to stress of the user. Everyone hates a dysfunctional app! We also want to add additional skills to the app that can assist people of all ages. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    mit-app-inventor\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  drive.google.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

The more usage the more dollars allocated to the project. Current tracking devices are either hundreds of dollars or are not internet connected meaning there is a delay of sometimes months before data is gathered. This solves both problems.\n\nWhat it does\n\nNotices motion and posts data using MQTT. The device is flexible and cheap enough to be disposable in case of tampering/theft and to run over multiple service networks (wifi, cell, etc).\n\nHow I built it\n\nAn arduino clone (esp8266) connects to an MQTT server and posts when motion is sensed. A script subscribes to the channel and inserts motion events into a database with a time stamp for post processing. The current implementation can scale to thousands of devices for less than $50 a piece.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nCode not working when it was...\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nAs an advocate for improved biking facilities, seeing the current backlash against lanes in my own city, and knowing how limited budgets are for advocacy groups this project can really make an improvement in the lives of Baltimore citizens.

We used a pre compiled database of civil cases which is updated daily in (built before the hackathon). Our analysis of this data determined the 4 zip codes with the highest default judgment rates were 21213, 21215, 21217, 21218. In these zip codes in 2016 out of 3,132 civil cases there were 2,080 default judgments entered against them. \n\nThe Reason:\n\nThere are several reasons for this. One problem lies with the people who serve the lawsuit on the defendants. These people are known as process servers. They have a financial incentive to serve improperly or even not serve at all. In these situations the defendant never knows they have a court case and they will almost certainly lose automatically.\n\nThe Solution:\n\nThe program will check the pre built database of civil cases each night. Find defendants in those zip codes at risk who the court claims have been served. The program will then connect through API to a company who will mail a post card to the defendant. The postcard contains their case number, who is suing them, when/where their court date is, and resources to call if they need legal help. The post card only costs 70 cents to send and with a grant of just a few thousands dollars we could inform everyone in those zip codes of their court date.\n\nMeasurable:\n\nThe program does have measurable analytics because we can compare the rate of default judgments for people who receive the post card versus those who didn't.\n\nTest It!:\n\nThe program will run entirely on the back end without a user interface. However, to demonstrate the program and see what the generated post card looks like we have built a user interface at https://cluesearch.org/Postcard/. \n\nPost Card:\n\nThe program will then send a post card to the defendant with information on\n\n\nWho is suing them\nCase Number\nWhen their court date is\nWhat time their court date is\nWhere the court house is\nInformation on how to get help.\n\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    phphtml\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n        \n  \n  cluesearch.org\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  Inspiration\n\nThere are 80 bus lines serving Baltimore's public transportation needs, along with other services that include the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC Train. With nearly half the population of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car, the MTA is an important part of the regional transit picture.\n\nThere are currently several ways to access bus schedule information but all require using a specific app or visiting a website. For the hackathon I attempted to integrate that information into a more casual, friendly and direct experience with the Amazon Alexa. \n\nMTA publishes schedule and real time information data online for use by developers in the in General Transit Specification Feed static and real time (GTFS and GTFS-RT) data formats. GTFS-RT is realtime is a feed specification that allows public transportation agencies to provide application developers with real-time updates about their fleet.\n\nWhat it does\n\nAmazon Alexa skill using open transit data (GTFS, GTFS-RT) to provide MTA (bus, light rail, Metro, and MARC) transit updates,service updates, and vehicle information. For example, a user could say \"Alexa, ask Maryland Transit when the next 8 will be at Greenmount & North.\"  Alexa would then say \"The next 8 will arrive at Greenmount & North in 20 minutes.\"\n\nHow I built it\n\nAmazon allows users to create new capabilities for Alexa known as \"skills\" that can be downloaded/utilized by other users. I set up the skill interaction model in the developer portal (eg. the infrastructure for Alexa to know what to listen for and what user inputs to store) created the skill logic using AWS Lambda with the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js (eg. programmed the algorithms that run inthe cloud to access the Maryland GTFS-RT data), added the Lambda function to the skill (connected the algorithms to the Echo's actions using event handlers).\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\ncreating node.js deployment package for AWS lambda\n\nWhat's next for Maryland Transit Alexa Skill\n\nThe new Baltimore Link will be launching on June 18, 2017. So my goal is to continue to learn how to synthesize the current static and dynamic GTFS formats with the Amazon Alexa in anticipation of the new data sets. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    node.jsamazon-alexaaws-lambdajavascriptgtfsgtfs-rt\n  \n\n      \n    ",

Users can answer this question, and at a set time each day receive the responses from all other users within a 20 mile radius of them. Users may also leave notes in their reflection journal, and set the reflections to be sent back to them at a later date. Through this, users can chart their own mental progress, and how their ideas have been informed by those around them.\n\nHow we built it\n\nParse is an iOS app built using Swift. It uses a MongoDB database to store all user responses, which is hosted with Heroku. The Parse API, originally developed by Facebook but recently open sourced, is used to make queries and determine what posts fall into the user's radius.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nMany of us had little to no experience developing iPhone apps, so we had to learn multiple backend and frontend technologies entirely new to us.  It can become a particularly acrobatic art when you're chasing down error with a few hours to go concerning technologies which you have less than 36 hours of experience with.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe were able to develop a fully functional iOS app in a single day! We feel our user interface compliments the app's intentions and provides an inviting atmosphere for users.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nThrough this project, we learned to develop an iOS application from wireframing to back end implementation, and look forward to taking this knowledge to future projects.\n\nWhat's next for Pulse\n\nWhile we intend to keep Pulse very simplistic, we will be adding additional user customization features, including setting the color gradient for the app. When scrolling through user responses, the background will adjust to the color of that response's user to further connect users. We intend to publish the application soon, and gradually expand the userbase from Baltimore, to the United States, to Worldwide.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    swiftmongodbparsejavascript\n  \n\n      \n    ",

We built this app with the idea, prevention is better than cure.\n\nWhat it does\n\nThe mission is to help people keep themselves safe by monitoring diseases around the world in real time, particularly those prevalent in each user's area, and offering them tips from the WHO and CDC to reduce their chances of contraction. It works on two ends. The doctor can quickly register and then report the number of cases of various infectious diseases that he/she saw. On the other end, the user (and the doctor) is able to view a map showing the geographic distribution of the diseases, progression through a timeline feature, and severity through changes in color intensity.\n\nHow we built it\n\nSince we had two iOS programmers on the team, we decided that the best representation for our project would be an iOS application. We began programming with Xcode and created the user interface using the Interface Builder. Additionally, we used Swift to programmatically set up the interface and run algorithms in the background to filter our data based on user input. Firebase was our choice of database since it was easiest to setup. Photoshop was used for all graphic design.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nWe initially imagined a simple application which we estimated would take 10 hours to program. However, as we became more ambitious, we decided to add functionality which increased program complexity and essentially tripled our programming time. Features which we took for granted, such as drawing circles actually ended up being more cumbersome. Additionally we had problems with scoping variables since we did not follow a MVC design. \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nDespite all these challenges and lack of sleep, we managed to produce a functioning prototype that has some serious potential in public health.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned to work with each other since we have different backgrounds and expertise, and how to delegate responsibilities. \n\nWhat's next for Pathogen\n\nThis is a public health initiative, and we aim to take it to doctors around the world. First, we will seek input from public health experts at the Bloomberg School of Public Health and then we will begin to implement this program in Baltimore. If it succeeds, we will expand and take it to other cities in the US, and eventually around the world. One feature that we want to include, that we have not been able to in this prototype, is connecting this platform with the programs doctors use in the office when seeing patients, writing the diagnosis and course of treatment. We believe that this app will become more convenient for doctors if diagnoses can be pulled automatically and confidentially from these medical programs, without requiring the doctor to enter in the data.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    swiftxcode\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  Inspiration\n\nPart of the discrepancy with adequate global health care during epidemics arises from a lack of a stable communications network. In the recent ebola outbreak, we saw a number of health care facilities shut down as staff were evacuated, which created a secondary and potentially more damaging issue. The communications network is critical to providing us with a way to track and identify community need to better determine the most effective allocation of resources. \n\nWhat it does\n\nWorld globalization and the increasing threats of globalization led to R.E.S., our Regional Epidemiology System. By connecting people to providers, we hope to lead two initiatives: Aid and detection. These are accomplished through our five core goals, which include community integration, data streamlining, global connectivity, technological innovation, and connectivity and mobilization. \nR.E.S. begins with a community focus \u2014 starting here in the heart of Baltimore. Due to the increasing disparity between high and low income families, dramatic need allows us to tailor R.E.S. as a pilot program for improving community health. By combining the core strengths of two APIs, Twilio and SickWeather, R.E.S. has the capability to link community provided data about health to develop a threat level index for a specific area. Through further awareness and transparency, the advanced, integrated cellular AI can give patients further information on the threat level index, potential epidemics, local alerts, and proximal solutions. Our goal is that useage of a cellular network will allow us to connect the two populations who are most likely to be affected in epidemics: Low-income families and the elderly. \n\nHow we built it\n\nR.E.S. was built through a creative combination of APIs, JavaScript, and HTML. \n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nPart of the difficulty in developing a system for monitoring epidemics is the differences in communities around the globe. We started here in Baltimore because it provides us with a unique platform for both first-world and third-world countries, as reflected by the race and income discrepancies. \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe want to engage people in global health development. Connecting communities to clinics will help us grow a network for epidemic prevention and health care response \u2014 and we believe that R.E.S. helps us do just that. \n\nWhat we learned\n\nEpidemiology systems must be continuously updated to reflect the newest information and the hardest link will be making sure that providers can see and respond to need. \n\nWhat's next for Regional Epidemiology System\n\nOur goal is for R.E.S. to work for everyone, everywhere. After pilot testing in Baltimore, we hope to expand to communities around the globe, connecting with local NGOs, governments, and volunteers to mobilize and allocate resources and efficiently and effectively as possible. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    twiliogoogle-mapssick-weathergoogle-places\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  dontpanicyet.herokuapp.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  Created for Community Infrastructure!\n\nInspiration\n\nChanging community infrastructure is difficult without policy change, so we wanted to try and put that change into the hands of the people who would really be affected by it; the people of Baltimore City. By giving them an easy interface, that includes fitness, health, and safety recommendations, we hope to raise their self-efficacy in their fitness endeavors and to realize that they can flourish without the need for gyms in the area.\n\nWhat it does\n\nThis website gives the people of Baltimore City the information and the tools to better their fitness and health, while also allowing them to become active in their communities while maintaining their safety. Users can access three tools: \n\n\na Baltimore Map listing all incidences of crime so they understand safe and unsafe areas around them to walk or exercise as well as the location of recreation centers in the area,\na Fitness Game Plan that uses their zip code and demographic data to give them fitness recommendations and \na Nutritional Game Plan (beta) that uses their zip code and demographic data to give them nutritional data\n\n\nHow we built it\n\nWe used weebly as our primary web platform. This is how we plan to interface with potential users. For backend data sources, we used data from Baltimore City Organizations that provided crime data points and placed them onto an interactive map to allow users to easily inform themselves of potentially unsafe areas around them and learn about safe areas near them to exercise. We used the Google Maps Layering feature to layer numerous data points imported using a CSV format from these databases Google Maps. \n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nWe had originally planned on tracking sidewalk locations and streetlight locations in neighborhoods and incorporating that information into our Google map, since the presence of those has been shown to raise fitness levels in areas where they are located. After lots of searching, it became apparent that this information was not open source, or even available. \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nThis was the first hackathon that all 3 of us have participated in, so I\u2019m sure we are all proud that we have a finished product! \n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned a lot about amazing tools that are out there in terms of health tools and software, website development and html. We feel like we have a game plan now of tools that we can learn before our next hackathon!\n\nWhat's next for SafelyFit\n\nHopefully we will be able to expand past just Baltimore City to include other areas with nutrition and fitness deserts. We also hope to be able to incorporate grocery delivery to compensate for food swamps/deserts. Also, the inclusion of sidewalk and street light locations would be great to include into our SafelyFit map when/if that information were to become available.\n\nAdditional Info\n\nCheck out the three links below for more information about our project!\n\n\nThe link to our published website\nLink to an example automated email sent to users after their submission\nLink to our Business and System Set-Up\n\n\nShout out to Mentors\n\nWith this being our first hackathon we had to learn, and we were so glad to have so many hackers who were willing to lend their time and suggestions to our first project! We not only learned a lot about user interaction and widget integration, but also cool tools and tips to use at future hackathons. Specifically big shout out to Aviral Srivastava and Saurabh Khandelwal who provided us with a lot of feedback!\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    weebly\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  www.safelyfit.weebly.com\n\n        \n  \n  drive.google.com\n\n        \n  \n  docs.google.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  Inspiration.\n\nDespite the countless methods to address health, fitness, and nutrition needs within the community, in order to optimize implementation and development of health infrastructure, it is paramount to understand current and local community needs.  Working with available and accessible tools\u2014Google Maps and Algolia APIs\u2014we can evaluate to current locations and services to address this health related issue.\n\nWhat it does.\n\nMirage Map is a web application that determines current locations and services based on community health infrastructure facets of health, fitness, and nutrition. Individual (patient specific) address can be input into the application and surrounding health infrastructures\u2014health clinics, supermarkets, fitness centers, and other services\u2014can be visualized.\n\nUsing Baltimore as a standard city-scale community model, we implemented population density and median income data based on zip code to examine potential primary care deserts, nutrition deserts, fitness deserts, and transportation deserts. We normalized the scores of each service to calculate the risk factor for potential health infrastructure deficit.\n\nUsing the functional maps, health infrastructure deserts are visualized to target areas of high risk factor to find direct solutions. Optimized solutions can be implemented based on community need\u2014building a brand new clinic in high density and high risk communities, or advertising fitness services to lower density and high risk communities.\n\nHow we built it.\n\nWe learned to use Google Maps API to fetch real-time location data [1]. The code is based on Javascript. Python was used to develop a model for risk assessment and optimization using census data. \n\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/\n\nAccomplishments we are proud of.\n\nWe strongly believe that our application addresses the foundational issue associated with community health infrastructure. Mirage Map arises awareness of risk for health deserts in any area by addressing each level of the community.   We are proud that our app is hosted Google Cloud, making the valuable information accessible to everyone\u2014patients, researchers, and practitioners.\n\nCheck it out here:  https://medhacks-215721.appspot.com \n\nWhat's next?\n\nOur start of Mirage Map is a relevant and translational idea. We aim to use these \u201cfunctional maps\u201d for future optimization of health infrastructure implementation.  \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    google-cloudgoogle-mapspythonflaskgooglejavascript\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  medhacks-215721.appspot.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

Locally, Baltimore consistently ranks as one of the nation\u2019s least literate cities. In 2016, five Baltimore schools did not have a single student who met the minimum requirements for reading proficiency. Further, 30% of adults in the city are considered \u201cfunctional illiterates,\u201d defined as people who have \u201creading and writing skills that are inadequate to manage daily living and employment tasks that require reading skills beyond a basic level\". In an article published just this morning, it was stated that 90% of low-income and minority students in the city cannot read proficiently.\n\nGlobally, 1 in 10 people are illiterate. From an economic standpoint, functional illiteracy holds economies back, costing the $1.19 Trillion globally, each year. A lack of literacy in our communities is not an individualized issue. Poor literacy also limits a person\u2019s ability to engage in activities that require critical thinking and/or a solid understanding of literacy and numeracy skills. Such activities may include comprehending governmental policies and voting in elections, making educated financial decisions such as buying a home and managing a mortgage, or completing a degree of higher education.\n\nToday, more than 750,000,000 people cannot read this sentence.\n\nAt its root, this disparity in literacy breeds from a lack of access to education supplemental tools. Our team seeks to remedy this widespread issue by leveraging the power of Augmented Reality (AR) with commonly accessible devices.\n\nWhat it does\n\nThe Stell.AR Speller application enables users to practice literacy in an intuitive, engaging, and effective environment. On an iOS or Android phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer with a camera, users can scan a letter, and on-screen pops up interactive 3D visualizations of words that begin with that letter. This engages the user, familiarizing them with concepts related to that letter of the alphabet, thus, encouraging word familiarity and literacy.\n\nThe app is best optimized for the iPhone X.\n\nHow we built it\n\nThe development of this project began with exploring the possibilities of Vuforia, an AR platform that is natively supported in Unity.\n\nAfter much effort, we could successfully overlay 3D data visualizations atop an image. We accomplished this by first uploading the \u201ctarget\u201d/base images (in our case, the letters A, B, and C) to the Vuforia database.\n\nVuforia performs image processing, and rates the identifiability of the image that we uploaded. In our case, our target images received a score of 5/5, meaning that they were ideal candidates, and could be identified by the software, likely, with a consistently high success rate.\n\nWe then imported those target images into Unity 3D, as well as publicly available 3D models from the Unity Asset Store. These models each correlated to a letter. For example, for the letter A, we have a target image with 3D models of an apple, acorn, ape, and airplane. These visuals were then placed atop the target images.\n\nWe created scripts in C++ to include gestures that allow the user to iterate through the various 3D models on-screen.\n\nThis functionality was then built into an Xcode community file and deployed for iOS. Given that we utilized Unity, which has platforms for iOS, Android, as well as desktop versions for Mac and PC, our application is usable across most every device.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nOur team sought to better support users with disabilities. We put immense effort into integrating sound effects to the 3D visualizations, as well as a swiping mechanism, to be able to see each AR element closer. Their implementation was not fully functional within the 36-hour timeframe. However, we are determined to continue to refine and innovate the application that we have developed here at HopHacks!\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nOur team is composed of a diverse set of members, who had not previously met before Friday. The collaboration of skills, support, and efficiency of our team has been beyond admirable. \n\nThe integration of open source tools and public APIs in our project, most notably, Vuforia, has been a great success, especially considering that the members of our team did not have previous experience with it.\n\nOur user interface is another feature that we put a lot of consideration and diligence into. We wanted to make this application appealing, intuitive, and efficient for users of all ages and levels of technical skill.\n\nFurther, we are incredibly proud of the fact that our project runs! Interoperability (as well as blatant operability) is incredibly important to our group, and the fact that Stell.AR Speller operates across different devices and operating systems, efficiently, is a great accomplishment of our team. \n\nWhat we learned\n\nThroughout this hackathon, we learned countless lessons in implementing the tools that we utilized, especially in regards to Vuforia and its integration with Unity 3D.\n\nWe also learned that AR and humanitarian work operate in tandem far better than we could have fathomed. While using technology as a means of alleviating a global issue may seem far-fetched to some, our group found that it made learning tools accessible to a larger audience, and enables us to tailor the tools to support the needs of our users.\n\nWhat's next for Stell.AR Speller\n\nWe have a multitude of ideas for ways to advance Stell.AR Speller. \n\nAs previously mentioned, we would like to better apply sound effects and interaction with the 3D visualizations to allow users to engage with the assets in a more dynamic way. \n\nUnderstanding the AR capabilities of the iPhone X hardware, and integrating Apple\u2019s ARKit, per the suggestion of the wonderful sponsors Mission:Data and JHU Applied Physics Laboratory, are revolutionary aspects to consider.\n\nIn the interest of best optimizing our time, we limited our app to support the letters A, B, and C. Fundamental aspects that we would like to include in future improvements are expanding the app to support the entire English alphabet. We would also like to provide functionality that accounts for more robust linguistics, such as words, phrases, sentence structure (\u201cThe cat chases the mouse\u201d vs. \u201cThe mouse chases the cat\u201d) and providing animated visualizations to represent these. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    vuforiaunitygithubxcodeiosandroidvisualizations3d-visualizationsphotoshopc#\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

Leonid (Leo) Iogansen, who developed the original Tolls Calculator USA & Canada iPhone app in 2014, came up with the idea after running out of cash on a toll-laden trip from Baltimore to New Jersey and ended up getting a ticket.  It left him thinking there must be a better way to prepare travelers for tolls in advance of a trip. He wished there to be a product which would not only display routes on a map, but would also calculate tolls expenses for these routes. \n\nJim Kovarik, an entrepreneur and former AOL executive, had already developed an industry-leading fuel cost calculator application (the Galculator) for Cost2Drive, and had been looking for a toll calculator to complement it given that 50,000 people were visiting the site each month in search of toll cost information, a number that was doubling every year.  Jim and Leo decided to combine efforts and in April 2015 cofounded Tollsmart, a Virginia-based LLC with a mission to provide full transparency around tolls so people can make smarter, more economically-sound driving decisions.\n\nAs we were developing the API for our toll calculator application we were thinking about the many potential use cases and noticed that there were many people posting questions on Twitter regarding whether or not toll costs are included in the price estimates provided by Uber.  In most instances the answer was 'no' and so we felt we could provide a valuable add-on service to Uber by providing price estimates that are inclusive of tolls.\n\nAs we further developed our Tollsmart iPhone application to where it now provides toll costs for alternative routes, it presented another opportunity for Uber customers to see which route would be the most cost-effective factoring in both toll and Uber costs.  We felt this was an innovative service to enable Uber customers to make more informed suggestions to Uber drivers regarding routing.\n\nAdditionally we felt we could bring a whole new audience to Uber, those who were using the Tollsmart app in advance of driving someplace who would then see that the Uber service was available for their itinerary, and at reasonable prices thereby creating more awareness for Uber and delivering more customers.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    amazon-web-servicesxcodejavaobjective-cgoogle-mapsgoogle\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  tollsmart.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  Inspiration\n\nSix years ago, our group member Mark bought the sign at the Baltimore HamFest. Since then, we have been bringing it with us to all of our Hackathons, intending to use it as a side project, just for fun. Unfortunately, we have never gotten the sign into a stable working state. That is, until now.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe sign is driven using a Teensy 3.1 for the realtime scanout, and a RaspberryPi to generate the frames. A series of applicantions written in Python can be selected in a menu system we developed. The sign is also capable of controlling x10 devices using an Arduino Uno based bridge connected to a TW523 x10 line interface module. This allows our sign to control the warning light that currently adorns it.The game code is all written in Python, and the realtime code on the arduino and the Teensy is written in c.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nThere are several reasons that this is the first Hackathon where we managed to get the sign working. Perhaps the foremost reason is that the scanout hardware inside the sign is undocumented and was originally designed to display closed captions retrieved from an analog tv signal. Getting the sign to work required the drive electronics being substituted.\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nWe made more than a dozen demos for our system, including several multiplayer games, internet enabled services, and cool patterns such as Conway's Game of Life. \n\nWhat I learned\n\nQuite a lot about reverse engineering! Driving the display requires tight control of a system we didn't build, and several major modifications to the original driver circuit had to be executed.\n\nWhat's next for LED Sign and Demos\n\nWe hope to design more simple games and utilities to our sign and add as much functionality as possible. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    pythoncrestraspberry-piteensyhardwarerealtime-controloscilloscopearduinotwitter\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

However, over the course of the term, students unfortunately become homeless and need to re-locate.  In order to ensure that homeless students can continue to attend the same school and maintain an element of stability during a turbulent time, the school district provides transportation accommodations for these students.  These additional accommodations can often be costly, as students' new locations can frequently be outside of existing transportation routes established at the beginning of the year.  \n\nProposed Solution\n\nIf a model was developed to help identify factors leading to homelessness and anticipate homeless students' re-locations, these changes could be accounted for during the initial route construction at the start of the school year.  This would provide more efficient and reliable transportation for homeless students and savings to the school district.  Additionally, the model itself could be used to better understand the driving forces behind student homelessness, which could help in mitigating its effects.\n\nTimeline, Resources and Group Skills\n\nThe primary resource that will be needed is access to data.  Receiving access to student data that identifies whether or not a student is or has been homeless, along with relevant socio-economic data, will be critical in constructing a model.  Additionally, access to administrators, teachers and students will be very helpful in identifying possible factors that could indicate that students will be moving due to homelessness.  \n\nOnce the initial data has been gathered, an exploratory data analysis can be performed to identify broad trends and provide the context for next steps.  Since some team members already have data analysis skills and can leverage open-source software, no resources would be needed initially, and the preliminary analysis could likely be completed in 3-4 weeks.  However, once the project shifts from identifying causes of homelessness to determining how homeless students re-locate, additional resources might be needed to procure software packages that specialize in analyzing geospatial data.  The exact extent of the analytical work that can be done and the necessary tools that will be needed can be more accurately assessed once the initial data is received.\n\nHackers: Andrew Molchan, Brigitte Granger\n\nCollaborators: Shayna Robinson, John Land, Robin Neal, Lara Ohanian\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    rbcps-student-data\n  \n\n      \n    ",

We'd make several different maps that tackle different aspects of the problem and use them as discussion starters for new conversations with BCPS transportation experts. \n\nWe would also create visualizations that propose potential solutions to any problems that we identify. We'd work with BCPS to visualize potential solutions that they come up with as well. \n\nData needs: routes for everything (from routing software?). School locations. Student homes.\n\nHow we'd use the money: possibly for amazon cloud processing of large data sets. Also possibly for hiring a transportation engineering grad student (from Morgan State via one of our team members) to fill in missing pieces in expertise in mapping or data processing.\n\nTeam Members:\n\nBryan Connor \nbryan.j.connor@gmail.com\n\nAlex Nastetsky\nseashelf@gmail.com\n\nsteven nutt\nstevennutt@gmail.com    \n\nAudrey DeGross                                                                                                      A.Degross@transdev.com\n\nCeleste Chavis\nceleste.chavis@gmail.com\n\nRandall Ziman\nrandall.ziman@gmail.com\n\n\n\n      \n      \n    ",

It is the first copyright restriction-free, open data publication of the Baltimore Law, and presents the law in the same awesome State Decoded format as the recently-released MarylandCode.org.  Developers Will Koper and Chester Nwachukwu joined our own Chris Birk to unleash the B'More law.  This Bud's for them.\n\nBefore this project started, Baltimore citizens faced significant barriers - legal and technical - when trying to know the laws, let alone when trying to unleash the data in applications or modern web design.  (Click here to learn more about the barriers like copyright restrictions, PDFs, bad search and bad design, among others.)  Hacking together, we started to demolish these barriers with BaltimoreCode.org by publishing the city law in a human-friendly, open XML format...with a delicious API cherry on top for your coding & re-using pleasure.  \n\nThanks go to the Baltimore Department of Legislative Reference for their great work taking care of the law and handing it off to Baltimore Mayor Rawlings-Blake's OpenBaltimore Team for publishing here under a Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license.  Click here to watch Mayor Rawlings-Blake kick off the hacking on June 1, 2013.\n\nRight now, we're adding features and fixing bugs on the issues page and looking to enhance the project while deploying it to open up, remove restrictions on, and modernize the law in cities and states across America.

Since property taxes are directly proportional to property value, this map also provides interesting views on the the variation of property values throughout the city.\n\nThis app was inspired by the AppsForPhilly \"How AVI Affects Taxes\" map (http://apps.axisphilly.org/avi-map/).\n\nFuture improvements on the map will focus on incorporating tax credit information to depict actual paid property tax after credits have been assessed.  This will give a better impression of the actual tax burden of homes dependent on the resident's income.\n\nNote: The link may or may not work depending on whether the final map files have been uploaded to the server yet.\n\n\n\n      \n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  a.tiles.mapbox.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

That's because Baltimore has a very high unemployment rate, which surpasses that of Maryland state and the USA. We realized many homeless people had already given up searching for the jobs since that is a very time taking activity and not always successful, hence we tried to ease this process by enabling the employers to post jobs, and enabling the users to search through jobs and apply directly from the website, by creating their resume online.\n\nWhat it does\n\nWe wanted to expand the user interface for it to include other people as well, such as people moving in and people currently living in the Baltimore area. Since not everyone, especially the homeless, has a cellphone, we made a website that is accessible and viewable from both computers and phones. This website integrates information from Open Data Baltimore with Google Maps API to show closest clinics, restaurants, shelters, grocery stores, job openings, and available houses for buying and renting to the location you put in. In addition to that, employers can post jobs, specifying salaries, description of the job, location of it, previous experience necessary and specific questions they want the employees to answer. Users can make resumes online and apply to different jobs. Others can post info about a house they are selling or renting out, and users can contact them if they are interested in buying or renting. It also shows graphs about unemployment.\n\nHow I built it\n\nWe used CSS, JavaScript, and HTML for the front end and design with the integration of JQuery.js, d3.js, d3pie.js for creating graphs. For the back end we used PHP and MySQL to load data into the database, and fetching it when we want to find for example closest clinics to one's location.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nThe location given in the datasets for longitude and latitude was incorrect, so we used Geocoding from Google Maps API to find the actual latitude and longitude using the address. The d3 was not able to graph the csv file at first, due to the very messy data, which we had to the repolish.  \n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nMost of the website is functional. We finally got the jobs that people post to show up on the main page google maps. The d3 graphs also work. We got the DataTable to work, which was at first impossible since we had too much data. Over 275,000 lines. \n\nWhat I learned\n\nI learned how to use d3Pie, Google Maps API, DataTables, and bootstrap library. \n\nWhat's next for MoreAboutBaltimore\n\nWe need to make sure the domain works, and try to get the crime locations to show up on the map. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    php5mysqljavascripthtml5css3d3.jsflowtype.jsjqueryphpmyadmingoogle-mapsbaltimore-open-data\n  \n\n      \n    ",

The cell isn't completely arbitrary --\nit's a Voronoi diagram, a visualization that partitions a plane into regions closer to a specific point than any other.\n\nSince the points we picked for this app are street intersections, we're playing Go on the city streets! \nAs of the demonstration, we've uploaded four maps on which to play -- one in Baltimore centered at JHU, one in New York, one in Hong Kong, and one in Rome.\n\nYou may see the game in action here.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    javascriptcsshtmld3.js\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  zdavidli.github.io\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  In the Age of Information, it is surprising how a large percentage of the population can be very misinformed about current events and unaware of their surroundings. In addition, it can be a daunting task to research past events and analyze trends of the local government 's interaction with the community. In a large city, knowledge of this information is not only an important requirement for good citizenship, but also for personal well being. In order to present the large amount of open source data provided by the city of Baltimore in a user friendly manner, we have created a web app known as the Urban Oracle!\n\nThe Urban Oracle was created using a combination of Python, JavaScript, and HTML. By interfacing with the Google-Maps API, it can provide a clear and aesthetically pleasing view of the city. In addition, information taken from the Baltimore Open Data website and accessed through the use of the Socrata API, local records can be visualized in real space, in order to provide an intuitive feel for where local government interactions have been and currently are occurring. In addition, the change in the geographic distribution of the data can be monitored as a function of time. Finally, Urban Oracle is capable of providing correlation analysis of two separate events, in order to satisfy the personal interest of the user. These comparisons can be viewed as either scatter plots or by displaying two sets of data at once.\n\nWhile this idea was only applied to information regarding Baltimore, the foundation has been laid to expand this service to other cities. Urban Oracle hopes to serve as a stepping stone to increased community involvement and awareness. As it continues to be developed, it will be able to evolve into a valuable third party service for the local population.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    pythonhtmljavascriptgoogle-maps\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

Property tax credits are provided by the state but homeowners are often unaware of them or the requirements for eligibility.  Furthermore, the website describing this program is densely written and difficult to understand.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to make the homeowner's tax credit and the data behind it more accessible.  We hope this will encourage more homeowners to learn about and apply for the tax credit.  Additionally we hope this will help community activists identify, inform, and assist other individuals who may qualify but have not yet applied.\n\nWhat it does\n\nThe project is primarily a web map intended to identify both owner occupied properties in the city as well and illustrate which homes were receiving a tax credit.\n\nAdditionally, we constructed a RESTful API for live access to official property tax records for each property included in the map.\n\nTo increase the usability and exposure of these elements, we built a website to provide awareness about the program as well as to highlight the map and provide information about how people can apply for the credit.\n\nHow we built it\n\nProperty data was gathered from the Baltimore City Open GIS portal.  This property data was processed in Python using the pandas and geopandas modules.  It was converted to raster tiles and styled in Tilemill.  Tiles were uploaded to Mapbox for hosting.  \n\nThe property tax API was generated by building a Flask app to generate the appropriate POST requests to cause the server to send back the HTML-formatted records for the requested property.\n\nThe website was built using Jekyll beginning with a pre-existing template and the site was hosted as a static page on github.\n\nLinks to github repos\n\n\nMap work in Python\nFlask API for tax data\nWebsite Repo\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nNot all of Maryland's data is \"open\".

This is a waste of time that increases emissions while wasting student's gas; a solution to optimize this is vital.\n\nProject Proposal\n\nI want to make a solution that will optimize people's time and reduce emissions by optimizing the parking flow at UMBC.  I am proposing a system that will track how many spots are available in which parking lots. So that when students drive into UMBC expecting to find a parking spot in a reasonable time, in the best possible location, they know exactly where to go.\n\nHow are we going to track what spots are available?\n\nUsing pneumatic vehicle counters on every parking lot entrance/exit. These\nvehicle counters will be able to collect...\n\n\nDirection of Travel (in or out of the parking lot)\nSpeed\nThe distance between vehicles\nThe length of each vehicle\n\n\nper vehicle. When this data is collected over a substantial period of time\nit can be used to make infrastructure improvements, view seasonal trends,\nimprove traffic flows, and much more.\n\nWhile all this data can be collected optionally, the only thing we really\ncare about for this application is the direction of travel for each car.\n\nHow will this data be transferred from the parking lot into the cloud?\n\nUsing Symphony Link from Link Labs. Symphony Link is a wireless solution for\nenterprise and industrial customers who need to securely connect their IoT\ndevices to the cloud. Symphony Link is optimized for low power and wide range\nwhich makes it a great candidate for this project.\n\nRXR / RLP Communication Modules\n\nEach parking sensor device will need a Link Labs RXR or RLP Communication Module\nwhich can connect to the Link Labs Gateway.\n\nGateway\n\nThis powerful device manages security, uplink and downlink, and much advanced low power,\nwide-area (LPWA) features only available with Symphony Link. For data backhaul, the gateway \nfeatures ethernet, WiFi, 3G cellular, or 4G LTE.\nThe Link Labs Gateway should be installed on one of the two cellular towers that\nare registered to the University of Maryland: Baltimore County. This would give\nthe Gateway a great enough range to cover the entire campus. Although more gateways\nmight need to be installed if capacity is too great (more than a hundred modules\nconnected to one gateway).\n\nHow will students view this data from the cloud?\n\nOnce we get the data to the cloud, it can go anywhere we want it to go. While\nmost people would make this a \"Parking App\", I think that is problematic. We\nshould not encourage students to drive while looking at their phone. This is not\na \"hands-free\" app and will need to be looked at in the car. An app is not the\nanswer to this question.\n\nWe should install Symphony connected signs that show up-to-date numbers for the\ncars that are in each lot. These signs need to be in strategic locations (such as\nthe UMBC entrances and in front of the Lots, etc.) that can be discussed and modified\nat a later date with more specifics. These signs will display a table of the selected\nlots and how many available spaces it has.\n\nThe display signs will use the same RXR/RLP Communication Modules to connect to the\nSymphony Network.\n\nProposal Architecture Diagram\n                   _                                  \n                 (`  ).                     _           \n                (     ).

I did this by creating a \"Sign Display Server\" and \"Parking Sensor Client(s)\" that would simulate how a large-scale deployment of this project would look when developed and deployed. Once the \"Sign Display Server\" is executed, it will accept an unlimited amount of connections from \"Parking Sensor Clients\". Each parking sensor client has the ability to simulate either a \"Car Leaving Event\" or a \"Car Entering Event\" in both manual and automated ways. All of the data is then collected, combined, and displayed to the user via the \"Sign Display Server\". Design Diagrams can be found below.\n\nHow I built it\n\nUsing python, I used the multiprocessing connection libraries along with many many threads to create this simple server-client model. Design Diagrams can be found below.\n\nSimulation Architecture Diagram\n                    //////////                          \n                    |  UMBC  |    The Display Device                         \n                    | 1: 15  |      / Parking Server.\n |^| --> --> -->    | 2: 50  |\n |@|                | 3: 2   | <-- <-- <-- <-- <-- <-- |^|\n                    |--------|                         |@|\n                    |        |\n\nSimulation Diagram Key\n|^| = Parking Sensor\n|@|    Client\n\n\n--> = TCP Connection\n\nIn order to simulate the Symphony Link network, I turned what would be the Display Sign Device into a server that the parking sensors instantly connect to. This connection can be seen as the direct replacement for the much more complex Symphony Link system.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nNetworking. I originally wanted to make a demo using our Symphony Link Gateways, Modules, and Backend; but I could not connect to our backends through the network's firewall. So since the connection to our backend was blocked by the network, I would have had to get a gateway with a cellular connection which I did not have access to as of implementing this project. So I improvised by creating a complete simulation.\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\n\nDesigning a Solution to UMBCs parking problem.\nNetworking in Python.\nQuick Prototyping.\n\n\nWhat I learned\n\n\nNetworking in Python.\n\n\nWhat's next for IoT Parking Solution for UMBC\n\nI would like to propose a legitimate solution to UMBC to finally solve our parking issue.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    python\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  We are applying for the Software prize.\n\nThe idea came from a simple question, \u201cWhat are the restaurants and grocery stores do with all the excess food at the end of the day?\u201d The only answer that came to mind is that it goes in the TRASH. Food that others, who are food insecure, could eat. Food that is still fully edible. Food that could be kept out of landfill and help people of Baltimore. That is what my brother and I set out to find a solution for. \n\nDuring a three day Hackathon at Digital Harbor Foundation called Harbor Hacks, we came up with a solution. We are built a website that would allow people, restaurants or supermarkets to post food that is headed for the dumpster but is still good to eat and distribute it to people that need it on a first come first served basis.\n\nThe poster would have control over the listing and could control when the item would be disposed. This project would also not hold the giver responsible of any liability. The recipients would have to sign in and sign a waver before they could search for items available.\n\nThis website was built to help get food to go into the hands of those that need it. It will add food availability to homeless shelters and individuals. This will specifically help people that are food insecure because it would protect their dignity and allow them to provide food for their family, rather than feeling embarrassed that they have to visit a pantry. It is a viable alternative to a soup kitchen or a pantry and it would keep our city\u2019s food waste out of the trash and into the hands of the less fortunate.\n\nTest the site here!\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    phpphpmyadminsqlmysqlhtmlhtml5csscss3\n  \n\n      \n    ",

The App our team will\ncreate for this Hackathon is in memory of Steve. Steve passed away after a\nterrible bike accident.\n\nThe Problem We'd Like to Solve\n\nHelp bike riders broken down and in need of assistance. This is a peer-to-peer,\npay-it-forward initiative for the bike rider community.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat it Does\n\nThe version we are about to build will be the main feature of the \u201cLaffer App.\u201d\nA bike rider will be able to send out a \u201cBike Signal\u201d to call for assistance.\nHelpers in the area will be alerted and may accept the call. The rider will will\nget periodical updates upon estimated arrival for help. All profiles in this\nversion are hidden for security reasons. The Helper arrives at the bikers\nlocation and provides assistance.\n\nHow We Build it\n\nNo code was written prior!\n\nThere are 2 versions for the App\n\nThe thinking behind 2 platforms is: More people/helpers to reach out too.\n\n\nA iPhone version developed by Greg\nAn Android version developed by Tony\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt is supported by a NodeJS backend developed by Roger\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nThere are so many features we like to add to \u201cLaffer\u201d.

Fortunately there are now a lot of breath taking insights available from new science that we can apply to our problems.  Of course these arguments start out technical and rather complex.\n\nOur task at the Hackathon 2015 is to condense some of the material we have developed into a TED style talk that is accessible to the general public.  This requires a few really good graphics supported by a heartfelt and concise talk running 10 or 18 minutes.\n\nOur specialty is the big-picture, which we find mysteriously missing at the moment.  You can find endless stories of zombies or machines run amuck, but just try to find stories of real people facing the real problems of the 21st century with both heart and mind.\n\nOur efforts to date are available at:\n\nBig Moon Dig / Essay\nhttp://bigmoondig.com/Essays/BMDWhyWhat.html\n\nThese efforts include a video we made for a contest this fall on solutions for the California drought.  In the big-picture, California and Baltimore are on the same planet.\n\nThis fall our task is to develop materials for the University of Baltimore course \u201cDivided Baltimore\u201d ( http://blogs.ubalt.edu/dividedbaltimore/ ) and the MIT Course \u201cULab: Transforming Business, Society, & Self\u201d ( https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+15.671x+3T2015/info ).  Our most important activities this weekend are to practice explaining our insights clearly and developing contacts.\n\nThis work is in the category of \u201cThe Big Picture\u201d, but the closest you have listed is \u201cSeafarer\u2019s Choice\u201d. \n\nTom Riley\nTomRiley@WoodwareDesigns.com\nThe Big Moon Dig\n\nUpdate Sunday morning:\n\nI am now rewriting the material into the form of a series of short TED talks.  Each will have a few good graphics and a straight forward exploration.  The first will setup up the idea and the last will give the specific proposals to address the problem.  I now have a first draft for the first TED talk.\n\n\n\n      \n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  bigmoondig.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

We decided that we wanted to program for fun again. We spend so much time working on corporate projects or college projects that we wanted to take this opportunity to just develop something that is fun to make and use. We also wanted to incorporate the pirate theme of the hackathon into our project. Our end product: An infinite pirate themed side scroller. \n\nHow we prepared:\nPrior to Friday, we installed the API's we planned on using for the hackathon and set up a git repository to help us coordinate as we build our game. We began this weekend with nothing more than a dream and a good night's sleep.\n\nTools we used:\nWe used and integrated multiple open source APIs to help us build our game.\n\n\nNode.js: \"A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine\"(*description taken from node.js webpage)\nExpress.js: Allows Webserver functionality\nPhaser.js: An html5 game engine\nSocket.io: Provides server/client functionality\n\n\nAll our graphics were generated using the beta version of Pyxel Edit. This tool allowed us to generate all the sprites and images displayed in Seafarer's Journey.\n\nWhere are we sitting: The far corner of the gym, next to the door to outside\n\nWhat would you like to do if you had more time/money? Future goals would be to host the game on a public webpage so more people could enjoy our hard work. Another thing that would be nice is improving the graphics by adding more details and making more sprites.\n\nChallenges we ran into:\nOne of the biggest challenges we ran into was setting up the server/client relationship to get other players to show up as a sprite in our world. Being able to send their position so that we could view them updating in real time was a tricky problem.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of:\n\n\nAbility for anyone on the network to connect to the game\nOther players showing up in our game instance where they are on the level.\nParallax style background moving at various speeds\n100% custom artwork made exclusively during the hackathon.\n\n\nWhat we learned:\nDave - Fun programming is still hard programming.\nMatt -  Graphics take a lot of time and patience.\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\nInstall node.js\n\nRun the followng commands using npm:\n\n\nnpm install phaser\nnpm install express --save\nnpm install socket.io\n\n\nOn Windows, you may have trouble using npm to install socket.io (may be fixed sometime soon) with nodejs 4.0.0. \nAs a temporary workaround, do the following:\n\nDepending on the date, a simple:\n\n\nnpm uninstall socket.io\nnpm install socket.io \n\n\nmay fix your issue - if the change to socket.io has been published to npm. If not, do the following:\n\n\nGo to C:\\Users\\%YOUR USERNAME%\\node_modules\\socket.io\\package.json\nChange the engine.io dependency from 1.5.2 to automattic/engine.io#7e77dd5\nAfter that edit, cd into your node_modules\\socket.io directory, and run npm install --production\n\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nUsage\n\ncd into the downloaded repo and run:\n\n\nIn a terminal: \"node app.js\"\nnavigate to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser\n\n\nContributing\n\n\nFork it!\nCreate your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature\nCommit your changes: git commit -am 'Add some feature'\nPush to the branch: git push origin my-new-feature\nSubmit a pull request :D\n\n\nCredits\n\nWritten by David Kramer and Matthew Hammel in one weekend.\n\nLicense\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) <2015> \n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Fabrication is almost done, all that's left is to glue things together and make it work.  The deadline of 1:00 will not be reached.\n\nSunday update:  Problem with circuits, it looks like we may not get the music part done.  Boo.\n\nMidnight Saturday update: We've successfully constructed two primary coils, two secondary coils, supports, and the circuit. We are aiming to get one test coil constructed before we leave tonight just so we can be sure our circuit works.Tonight Paul has some plasma cutting to do so we can put the coils on the helmet.But if this coil works tonight then tomorrow all we have to do is construction. We haven't even started on the modulator circuit yet, so we may not be able to make them play music this weekend :(\n\nWhat you see in some of the pictures we uploaded, in order:\n\n\nOur first tesla coil. We threw this together with stuff we had around just to make sure we had the science down and could tune the coils. It didn't make much of a spark but it did light up that bulb in the beer bottle. To clarify, that bulb is not plugged in. It's being powered by the field generated by the coil.\nWe found a great WWII helmet and polished it up, but the inside webbing was dead. Paul made some plates and brought his pop riveter so Jamie could reconstruct the webbing inside the helmet for easier (and safer HAHAHAHAHA) wearing. \nJamie in Inkscape designing our primary coil supports.\nCircuit diagram. We changed this a bit.\nBeautiful, Beautiful secondary coils. That's 30 gauge wire. Beautiful. \nWe're hoping to mount some fans to help with the heat. Bradford cut us some from my steel cans.\nLaying out the primary coil supports. Not drawn to scale. (Oh god, was it not drawn to scale. facepalm)\nStarting on the webbing for the helmet. \nBradford holding the coils he wound, both primary and secondary. He turned out to have as surprising aptitude for winding coils, so he is now our coil master.\nPaul and Bob soldering circuits. Despite the smile, Paul is not a serial killer. He's very nice.\n\n\n\nShort version: We thought it'd be cool. There were other things we thought'd be cool (drones with multiple cameras doing 3D surface mapping, mesh network devices, some projects not suited to an all-ages environment, some just goofy). This seemed to fit our skillsets and the time and space available.\n\nWhat we've done prior to the hackathon: Watch a lot of youtube videos, read web pages, pick a reference circuit, decide on how to customize it for our application. Order parts that can't be acquired locally. Use this as an excuse to pick up some tools we've been eyeing for a while. And last weekend, we built a small scale prototype based upon a different design with parts we had on hand (google Slayer Exciter). None of this coil will be reused; it was low power and only produced sparks a fraction of a mm long. But it could make light bulbs fluoresce. We also acquired the helmet, removed the paint and lining, and electrolytically removed the rust.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    pair-of-solid-state-tesla-coilscivil-defense-helmetmosfetsfiber-optic-isolation\n  \n\n      \n    ",

If you leave campus to get to a fraternity, but haven't been there before, it's easy to get lost and end up wandering the streets of Baltimore. BlackLight is an app that helps students safely navigate to and from parties by showing them which frats are active that night, and how exactly to get there.\n\nWhen you open the app, you are presented with a list of fraternities sorted by the number of people attending each one. When the app detects that the phone has come within 100ft of a known fraternity location, it will automatically \"check-in\" the user at that frat and update the number of people in attendance there. Using the Facebook login API we can also show users where their friends are, and also filter the displayed frats based on the school they attend.\n\nIf you don't know how to get to a fraternity, you can simply click a button and instantly receive step by step directions via the Google Maps API. We even support Street View to make it easy for users to verify that they are in the correct location.\n\nFinally, since safety is at the core of BlackLight, we've included a page with emergency links to Hopkins security and escort services. There's also a \"Get Me Home\" button that will give you directions on how to get back to your dorm.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    facebookgoogle-mapsherokjavascriptnode.jsobjective-cpostgresqlios\n  \n\n      \n    ",

To be more effective per diem rates should be set by using specific downtown zip codes to include the business area of the city. Areas outside of downtown should be separated into another area and suburban areas separated further.\nThis will allow the rates to be set on the business environment of each city and adjust the rates to more appropriate levels based on the area. This is currently done in Baltimore where there is a rate for the city of Baltimore and a separate and lower rate in the rest of the county. This same principle has been applied to Boston where Cambridge which is part of Middlesex County has its rates match Boston (Suffolk County) rather than the rest of Middlesex County as it has the same business environment as Boston.\nSavings will come from having travelers stay close to their business destination in a quality lodging facility. Currently those who cannot find accommodations at the current per diem levels are forced to stay in suburban locations, rent cars, pay for parking and gas plus the travel time factor between their business destination and where they were able to secure accommodations.\nWith the two working models listed above the frame work exists for Smith Travel to separate the lodging rates between city and county locations thus giving more accurate rates for each location.\n\n\n\n      \n      \n    ",

When mousing over a zip area you will see popups displaying additional data about the area including a d3 pie chart of the top 10 calls in each area. You can zoom in on an area by clicking on it. In order to create the boundaries of the choropleth we converted shapefiles to geojson files. We then used the zipcodes from the geojson file to perform searches on calls in the relevant zip codes. The Call Map view lists all of the reports for the various types of requests. To get more detail on a call click on one of the markers and a popup will show.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    socrata-open-dataleaflet.jsd3.jsweb\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  semesky.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

STEM is something most of my past peers couldn\u2019t imagine. Violence, high teen pregnancy and other issues in Baltimore are what most of our women face. STEM barely crosses their mind as something plausible.

In the case with non violent drug offenders not having proper medical care is associated with higher relapse and recidivism. \n\nHow we built it\n\nWe used Sketch App in order to build our product\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nThe main challenge was understanding the problem and a specific segment to tap into it. The opiate crisis has many stakeholders and therefore many areas to fix, and so no picking a niche market was pivotal and difficult. \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe are proud that we were able to think of an idea that could potentially aid hundred of thousand people each year in the United States\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned how bad the opiate crisis is, and how addiction is  a disorder that can physically rewire someone's brain. \n\nWhat's next for Rehabilita\n\nPotentially partnering with Blue Cross Blue Shield to implement our solution in Baltimore. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    sketch\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  docs.google.com\n\n        \n  \n  sketch.cloud\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

While they may be effective, they are exceedingly expensive. The stigma against more traditional workouts methods like jogging and swimming has been on the rise and are being seen as less \u201ceffective\u201d. \n\nThe inspiration for this project is the concept of community involvement and \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d fitness to increase motivation for living a healthier lifestyle. Using sustainable and cost-efficient methods, we created a system that inspires people to get to know their community members all the while, working out to a better future lifestyle. \n\nWhat it does\n\niFitness is an app that matches the users with people in their community that share similar fitness goals. The application uses a \u201cpeer to peer\u201d fitness system that motivates users to work out with each other based on their interests, goals, and comfort levels and provides rewards at each milestone reached. These rewards points can be redeemed for healthy food options reinforcing the message and the need for a healthier lifestyle. iFitness also provides users with a cost-efficient means to meet with fellow community members and participate in activities such as yoga in the park, and group morning runs. \n\nWe also integrated the usage of a chatbot service that can provide the users with the nutritional facts they desire. The chatbot is conveniently implemented into facebook messenger due to its popularity among all ages of people and its convenient accessibility. \n\nHow we built it\n\nThe team of 5 consisting of Varun Jain, Shaheer Hassan, Aidan Forsyth, Hafez Issa, and Abdullh Mohamed competed at the 2018 MedHacks Hackathon in Baltimore. The 5 used Adobe XD to create the design and basic functionality for an app that allows users to find fitness partners and fitness events in their area. In addition, Node.js along with several chat and communication-based modules (knex, axios, messenger, etc) was used to successfully create a chatbot that will provide the user with nutritional information as well as a fitness exercises through conversation. In the chatbot, Rasa-NLU was added so that basic phrases from the user would be understood from the bot.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nThroughout the Hackathon, there were various challenges we ran into especially in regards to brainstorming our idea for the hackathon. Thankfully, we were able to work around our challenges and successfully complete a project.\nFirstly, the ideas that we brainstormed were very complex and required a high level of programming ability, which none of the members of our team had. In fact, this was the first hackathon for all of our team members and we all either had minimal or no experience with programming. The first idea that we thought of was a blockchain system using SimplyHealth\u2019s KPS system to encrypt patient data. The problems that we encountered from this was storing complex values other than strings and integers. We were able to store a simple value such as Beats per Minute and blood pressure though. We also encountered a variety of debugging issues with our blockchain code. We also encountered issues with our fitness hub idea and this was because we were trying to combine a large variety of modules into one app. Coding the individual modules was not too difficult, but then we attempted the code for the app using Java and that proved to be great difficulty for our team. Through all of the struggles our team encountered, we were able to design our app using Adobe-XD as well as program a working chatbot that could be deployed onto facebook messenger. The last overall challenge that we had was adjusting to the new environment of the hackathon as it was the first hackathon for everyone on our team and we had no idea what to expect initially. We encountered a large number of surprises during this competition and they all had a positive influence on our experience at the conference.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe're definitely proud of the consistent accuracy that the chatbot services bring when stating nutrition facts. Not only that, but we are also proud in developing a user-friendly interface in the iFitness app that is fairly easy to use for all demographics. Even though we may not have coded up a fully functional backend to the application, we are proud to have developed a functional and eye-catching front end with little to no coding experience. Last but not least, we are extremely proud of the fact that this is our first hackathon and that we were able to complete a successful project with limited experience. \n\nWhat we learned\n\nThrough our experience at Medhacks Snow 2018, we learned how to manage a team of differently skilled individuals and combine everyone's skills into an interdisciplinary application. Through this, we also gained exposure to programming, design and had the opportunity to network with world-class researches and tech companies. Something that really took a while for us to realize is that hackathons aren\u2019t necessarily entirely digital, but there are other important social, accessibility, and implementation aspects that are crucial to the development of innovations, especially in community health and infrastructure. Most importantly, we learned the importance of making do with what you have in a limited time frame. \n\nWhat's next for iFitness\n\nGoing forth, we\u2019d like to fully integrate a functional backend with a user-profile login system. We\u2019d also like to acquire community partners to offer a wider variety of redeemable awards for our points service. Additionally, we would like to consult with the expertise of nutritionists and personal trainers that can provide valuable input for delivering a more effective service that will improve community health and fitness infrastructure. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    adobe-xdjavascriptfacebook-messengerfitbitknexaxiosrasa-nlu\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

Additional insight can be gained by considering the entire distribution of incomes.\n\nThis project was inspired by the need to better identify the range of incomes earned by households in different parts of the country.\n\nAdditionally, I wanted to automate map creation as much as possible.  From gathering and processing data to generating the map, I wanted everything to be done in code where possible.\n\nThere are a number of use cases possible for this data, but I had two specific cases in mind:\n\n1. Identifying low-income areas where many people are likely to be eligible for tax credits.\n\nThis use case is in support of an earlier project of mine: The Baltimore Tax Credit Map\n\n2. Finding areas where housing might be found that matches a family's income\n\nThis use was inspired by the challenge of trying to understand suitable places to live for a given income level, especially when moving to a new city.\n\nVisual styling and implementation was influenced by a recent WaPo visualization by Christopher Ingraham and Lazaro Gamio and this choropleth by Mike Bostock.\n\nWhat it does\n\nThe project is a series of interactive maps that allow users to view the relationship between income and location.  Users can choose an income range and see where in the a given city, county, state or larger region that people with annual household incomes in that range live.  Exploration is encouraged and quickly reveals high income, low income, and middle class areas.  Maps will be included for several major urban areas, though more can be generated on demand.\n\nHow I built it\n\nThe project consists of two primary components:\n\n1. Data gathering and cleaning\n\nPython scripts were written to gather income data from the US Census.  This effort was assisted by use of the Sunlight Foundation Census API.  Additionally, collection of necessary TIGER shape files was automated with Python.\n\nData from the census was cleaned and organized using pandas.  TIGER shapefiles were processed and filtered using geopandas.  The end of this stage results in a census data file in csv format and a separate shapefile formatted as geojson.\n\n2. Map visualization\n\nMap visualization was done using d3.js.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nTIGER shapefiles for tracts and block groups are packaged for each state as a whole.  Often, we are interested in only mapping one or two counties and thus it is necessary to filter out only the regions of interest.  I managed to accomplish this using the Python module geopandas and filtering the shape data to only include regions that were specified by the user.\n\nd3 is often counter-intuitive and difficult to work with.  The number of challenges I ran into with d3 are too many to list.\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nOn acquiring data:\n\nAt this point, I'm very proud of wrangling the US Census and TIGER shape data into submission.  There is a wide variety of information available from the US Census website, but understanding exactly what's available and how to get it is challenging.\n\nEven using an API, it can be difficult to figure out exactly what information is available.  The American FactFinder site was very helpful in this regard.  Once the desired data has been identified, the proper FIPS codes and Variable codes have to be found in order to automate data acquisition. Just managing to figure out how to automate this process was an accomplishment.\n\nOn visualization:\n\nI'm proud of the entire visualization.  Admittedly, a lot of it was only made possible by scouring and modeling off of similar projects, but just getting all the parts working together was a challenge.  This is one of my few projects with any real amount of interactivity or significant UI elements.  Getting maps to render properly is challenging.  Styling the shape fills based on data is challenging.  Having everything update properly when sliders and selections change is also challenging.\n\nHonestly, I'm still amazed the visualization works at all.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nThis is perhaps the most modular and reproducible mapping effort I have made to date.  Other than looking up county codes and census attribute codes, map generation is fully automated without any reliance on manual tools.  I have tested the code and found that it readily extends to multiple scales.  I also learned to manage my time pretty well given the ground that had to be covered for this project in less than 48 hours.\n\nWhat's next for Income Explorer\n\nFor data gathering, I intend to polish up my existing python code to make it more readily extensible to acquiring data from many metropolitan areas as well as attributes beyond household income.\n\nOn the visualization side, I plan to add additional interactive elements such as shape highlighting on mouseover as well as detailed tooltips.  Site design and styling can use improvement as well.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    pythonpandasgeopandascensus-apijavascriptd3.jsjquery\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  ryan-j-smith.github.io\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

The dog looked well-fed and cared for, but seemed to be very scared. While I was not in a position to make a u-turn and follow the dog, I wanted to find a way to contact the owner with the whereabouts of their dog. It took three days for me to find the Craigslist posting, and unfortunately at the time the information was unhelpful to the owner. If someone were able to see sightings of animals with similar descriptions to their pets, they could narrow their search considerably!\n\nWhat it does\n\nPaw Patrol is the Waze for pets- it posts lost pets, found pets, and pet sightings to an interactive map that updates in real time. \n\nIf Kim's pet runs out the door one morning on her way to work, she can post her lost pet with the location where it went missing, a description, and a photo. Paul's on his way to work and he sees a terrier running wildly at the corner of Baltimore and Caroline on the east side. He posts a description of the pet, the location, and a photo, enabling tracking of a pet. Paul's update creates a general location of the lost pet's whereabouts so Kim can start looking for her lost pet in an intuitive manner. The site also aggregates data from found pet sites so Paw Patrol will be a one-stop shop for finding pets. \n\nHow we built it\n\nThe site is built using Mapbox, an open-source JavaScript library that allows you to store and query a set of items based on their geographic location. We initially used a FireBase boilerplate and incorporated GeoFire to pull coordinate data from the FireBase database, but pivoted after learning (in a few hours) how intuitive and interactive Mapbox's API was in relation to our project. The database was populated by aggregated JSON data from various pet lost and found sites. The front-end was built with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and more. \n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nDealing with the HTML5 canvas was problematic on every level. The map was housed in the canvas and any attempt to style the map, even wrapping it in a div, resulted in doom. On the back-end, a large pain point was pulling in the coordinate data from the database and incorporating the real-time components. The data aggregation through node presented a challenge in formatting the database as well, but with a lot of elbow grease, ingenuity, and quick-thinking, we were able to come to a finished product that we're quite excited about! \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe all come from varied backgrounds (designers, developers, and game designers), and was able to not only come together and work in functions outside of our job titles and comfort levels, but learn completely new languages, libraries, frameworks, and platforms in a few hours. We worked together, laughed together, and figured out how to make Google Maps conform to our bidding. We tested, broke, retested, and pivoted. We laughed, we almost cried, and we went from strangers to buddies in a matter of days. This was an amazing experience and we're all very proud to have gotten this far. \n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned various tricks and conventions in Firebase, Mapbox, JSON, node.js, jQuery, GeoFire, and more. We strengthened our knowledge of database structure, and learned new ways of accomplishing queries and data calls. We also got really good at version control and working collaboratively in Git/Github. \n\nDid you start on the project before the weekend?\n\nAmanda did some basic planning on Trello. \n\nWhat existed before you started?\n\nWe used MapBox and FireBase open source code. \n\nWhere are you sitting?\n\nBy the kitchen in the main room. \n\nWhat's next for Paw Patrol\n\nWe are all committed to creating a production-ready, polished product that pet owners love, and have a laundry list of features that we'd love to accomplish for the future, including: \n\n\nGeolocation as a starting point for the map \nAn added searchable database for lost/found animals\nAn accompanying mobile app\n\n\nThank you!\n\nThanks so much for considering our project. We'd like to publicly thank and show appreciation to the Baltimore Hackathon 2015 organizers for pulling together such an amazing event, Angelique Weger for introducing us via the DevGrrls Slack group, and to coffee, Red Bull, and soda which fueled our development marathon. And bacon, because Mira really likes bacon. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    html5css3firebasejavascriptrubyjquerynode.jsgoogle-maps\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

The most complicated component of this was implementing the maze generation. We chose to generate a braid maze so that there would be very few dead ends. Our algorithm started by adding walls around the border of the maze. Then, we added walls at random within the maze without causing an dead ends. This created a maze-like structure of walls that did not necessarily have a solution and could have certain sections completely cut off from the rest of the maze. To connect these sections, we first identified each section with a unique id. Then, we went through every wall in the maze and checked if it separated two cells of different labels. If it did, we deleted the wall and changed all of the connected cells to a single id. Once all the cells had the same label, the maze was entirely connected and was finished. In order to punish the user for crashing into walls, we took advantage of the fact that the background was black. In order to check if the mouse had collided with a wall, we simply checked if the color at the mouse position was not black.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nIt was difficult to get the maze generation algorithm working because we went into it without fully understanding how we would approach implementation, so we had to rewrite our program structure multiple times. We originally stored the maze as a simple array of all the wall segments. Because it was completely unorganized, we had to search the array every time we wanted to manipulate a certain wall piece. We then stored the maze as a grid of cells, with 4 values each to show where the cell had walls, but this was inconvenient because there was no way of directly referencing walls. Also, one cell's top wall was another one's bottom, and so handling these duplicate walls was confusing and inefficient. We finally settled on the structure in place now: two arrays containing all the possible walls. This was the best way because we could refer to specific walls, and then find the walls around with a function of the index, which was much better than searching an array and did not have to handle duplicate walls.\nFor the graphics, we used an html5 canvas. This allowed us to draw directly to the screen and manage the ui at a relatively low level. The only downside to using a canvas over just html elements such as divs or spans was that a canvas's pixel size is fixed. This meant that if the window were ever resized, it would not be as simple as automatically adjusting relative positions for html elements. We had to recalculate the coordinates of everything we wanted to draw based on the new dimensions. Once this was completed, however, it did not interfere with any of the other components and was very reliable.\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nI am proud of getting the maze generation algorithm and the graphics to work without any outside code or libraries. Everything was done by us 100% from scratch during the weekend.\n\nWhat's next for Maze 2: Electric Boogaloo\n\nIf we had had more time we would have made a better ui, added enemies and items, and implemented a scoring system.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    javascriptcss3html5\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  www.tjhsst.edu\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

Custom computer software interprets hand gestures from a Myo Gesture Control Armband, sends the wireless commands to a Raspberry Pi mounted on the wheelchair, which in turn sends commands to an Arduino to operate one of two servos mounted next to the wheelchair's controller.  \n\nOur inspiration for this project came from a desire to do a hack that would have a humanitarian element. One of our members had a contact at The Delrey School who was able to lend us an electric wheelchair. Josh Z. and Luke met on the Hack-A-Thon\u2019s \u201cFind a group\u201d channel. Josh S. joined to offer his experience with hardware hacking and electronics.\n\nArmchair removes the requirement that the driver of an electric wheelchair be able to manipulate the control stick (or even be sitting in the chair at all). Using Armchair, a disabled person who has limited limb movement, shortened arms, or even one who is missing a hand entirely can still control their wheelchair with simple arm motions and muscle contractions.\n\nPeople\n\n\nJoshua Ziggas - Software Engineer, Anthem Engineering\nLuke Samuels - Sr. SysAdmin, ZOS\nJoshua Skillman - Electrical Engineer, BGE\n\n\nShoutouts\n\n\nThe Delrey School\nFelipe Albertao\n\n\nDependencies\n\n\nNodeJS, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.\nMyoJS, Thalmic Labs Myo JavaScript Framework.\nWebSocket-Node, A WebSocket Implementation for NodeJS.\nQ, A tool for creating and composing asynchronous promises in JavaScript.\njohnny-five, JavaScript Robotics and IoT programming framework.\n\n\nWork Performed Prior to Contest\n\n-Planning discussions only\n\nInstallation\n\nMyo Server\n\n\nnpm install -g q\nnpm install -g websocket\n./install_server_dependencies.sh\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Client\n\n\nnpm install -g websocket\nnpm install -g johnny-five\n\n\nUsage\n\nMyo Server\n\n\nnode myojs/examples/armchair.js\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Client\n\n\nnode armchair_client.js\n\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    javascriptnode.jsjohnny-five\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

The LiDAR only provides a range measurement. To image, the laser range finder needs to scan. Using a servo would add too much noise for accurate imaging, especially at a distance.  The worm geared gimbal we designed and built provides very accurate elevation and azimuth angles (in theory, based on gear ratios, an accuracy of 0.00013 degrees). In conjunction with the accurate range reading (to ~1 cm) and further processing algorithms such as superresoltion, a very accurate 3D image can be generated.\n\nHow I built it\n\nOn Friday night, we designed and 3D printed most of the gimbal parts (8 hours of printing). On Saturday we assembled the worm geared gimbal (printed parts + two stepper motors) and experimented with the LiDAR for the first time. We used an Arduino Uno for gimbal control and lidar data acquisition. We wrote a processing scetch to receive the data and display raw results. We also imported the data in Python for possible superresolution processing algorithms for subpixel resolution enhancement. \n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nDetection of position of Gimbal. Registration of one line to next. People walking in front of the scanner. Speed of worm drive (it is slow) due to very low cost stepper motors. \n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nOur goal was to 3d image an area or object with cheap parts, which we accomplished. The worm geared gimbal worked just as expected (though the $1 stepper motor was limiting factor). With additional detection of position, a better motor, and image processing, accurate 3d images/scans are practical. \n\nWhat I learned\n\nImaging with a laser is difficult. \n\nWhat's next for Worm LiDAR\n\nKeep working on it. Speed up be collecting by running lidar and gimbal at same time (limitation of Ardunio model) rather than start/stopping the drive (currently running at 100 hz). Could speedup  5-7x easily. That will also help with pixel registration. Additionally, a lot of room for sub-pixel resolution using image processing algorithms. \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    arduino3dprintingprocessingopencv\n  \n\n      \n    ",

        "description": "\n      \n    \n      \n\n          \n    \n    \n      \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n      \n  Inspiration\n\nAbout a year ago, I first saw the commercials for Amazon Echo. My immediate thought was, \"Oh man, that would be so cool if it had an app for doing recipes where it could speak the recipe to you. I love to cook, and I use my computer to find recipes. AllRecipes.com is my favorite website to get recipes from. However, it's always really frustrating when you're hands are messy and you're about to drop in the sriracha, but you can't remember if it was 1 tablespoon or 1 teaspoon. Now I need to wash my hands, dry them off, enter my password in (since my screen has locked again, find my place in the recipe again, and then go back to getting my cooking. Then it's rinse and repeat for the next step :)\n\nSince then, I've looked for apps that would solve this problem. Finally, I realized I could build it myself and found the Hackathon to be the perfect opportunity.\n\nWhat it does\n\nSous Chef solves this problem by allowing you to have a dialog with the web app. Sous Chef understands simple voice commands like, \"Next Step.\" or \"How many _____?\" and can talk back to you with the proper response. Now when you're standing in front of your bowl trying to remember how much sriracha to put in, just ask Sous Chef, \"How much Sriracha?\" Sous Chef will vocally respond with the amount you are looking for.\n\nSous Chef makes the process as simple as possible by also having an optional chrome extension. Found the perfect recipe on AllRecipes? Click the Sous Chef extension app and click, \"Let's Cook\". You're automatically redirected to the Sous Chef site and you're recipe is automatically loaded. You are immediately ready to start interacting with Sous Chef and start going through the list of ingredients!\n\nHow I built it\n\nSous Chef is built with a combination of HTML, Javascript, CSS, and PHP. Sous Chef downloads the DOM of a given URL with PHP. We then use javascript to parse through the DOM to give us a list of ingredients and steps. Finally, we use the Google Web Speech API and a wrapper called Annyang to give us voice command inputs and voice response outputs to the user. Finally, a chrome extension is built using a combination of HTML and javascript to make the web app incredibly simplistic to use.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nOur biggest problems were actually pretty silly. Javascript doesn't let you to get the DOM of a cross domain, even though there are a 100 other ways you can get it. This took up a few hours. We also ran into an issue where our app was working on our \"test\" server but not our \"production\" server. A few hours of painful debugging, turns out no one ever installed php on the \"production\" server. Ugh...\n\nBesides that though, we actually had a really smooth process and were able to finish extremely early. I credit this to having a good plan from the outset and constant communication between the two of us to make sure we both knew who was doing what and what we expected from the other person's code.\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nI was really proud that after a year of wanting to create this app I was finally able to do it. It actually was amazing how quickly we were able to do it and makes me want to go to more of these in the future to work on the other ideas that I have.\n\nI'm most proud that I decided last minute to tackle an entire area that I've basically never touched before and was able to learn it extremely fast. This really made me feel like I can take on anything!\n\nWhat I learned\n\nUp until Thursday night I had envisioned this as an Android app. However, I realized the day before the Hackathon that it would be much more useful for myself, and would be more universally usable by others if it was a web app.\n\nSo with that being said, I was really learning web development on the fly as I really never did much of it before. I hadn't done javascript probably since high school. Luckily, my partner Mike was well-versed so I was able to ask him a ton of questions. I love learning new languages and APIs so it was really exciting to take on a challenge that was completely new to me and I learned a lot.\n\nI think we learned most from the road blocks we ran into. We realized that (for some reason that makes absolutely no sense to me) you can't grab the DOM of a remote domain via Javascript due to security issues, even though there are a 100 other ways you can do it. Every issue we ran into we were able to overcome though which is a very satisfying feeling.\n\nWhat's next for Sous Chef\n\nIt really needs some field testing, which I'm excited to start! I would like to make using Sous Chef feel as natural as possible. That means, users can speak to it like they would if they were talking to an actual person. This is not a complicated task, I just need to figure out what someone would like to say to Sous Chef. Once I know how people would like to speak to it, it is trivial to match input commands to functions of the web app. \n\nI'd also like to experiment with voice modulation to see if I can find a more natural sounding voice. The standard voices sound a bit robot-y and I would like to make the experience more personable.\n\nWe could also work to include other popular recipe sites to parse. \n\nFinally, we would just be cleaning up some of the UI. The simplification of the recipe in the web app was actually an unintended side-effect, but when discussing with my girlfriend, that was actually one of her favorite features. We also feel like it adds a nice touch and it would be nice to dress it up just a bit so that the user feels like they're still getting a 1st class experience using our web app.\n\nWith these additions, I feel like we would actually have a MVP that we could setup on a real environment and actually host the web app. The chrome extension can also be included to make Sous Chef incredibly easy to use.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    javascriptphphtml5google-web-speech-apijquerybootstrap\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

It is great exercise and we have limited parking but with it getting darker earlier and my hours running late into the evening, I worry about motorists being to able to see me. I used an Instructable as a springboard and made some adjustments.\n\nWhat it does\n\nA roller is connected to the wheel of my bike which turns a stepper motor, sending a current to an old cell phone charger which then powers EL wire.\n\nHow I built it\n\nFirst I had to determine what wires coming out of the stepper motor were live and common. Then I had to break a few old cell phone chargers. The third try was a charm. I was able to identify the transformer and connect the stepper motor wires. Then things got a little weird. Rather than remove the remainder of the charger, convert the current and risk blowing out the EL wire, we decided to keep the charger and send the current on through to the EL wire pocket inverter. I was able to strip the charger cord and attach it to the positive and negative of the pocket inverter with alligator clips. We then attached the stepper motor to an electric drill and tested it. The EL wire lit up but not consistently. We were able to trouble shoot the button feature on the pocket inverter and get the wire to blink consistently. Then I had to determine how to attach everything to my bike, 3D design and print a roller, and solder all of the alligator clip connections. Determining how to attach everything took a lot of trial and error and zip ties. I had to get the angle of roller to be compatible with my tire and keep the rest of the device from interfering. Then I began soldering the components together. \n\nChallenges I ran into\n\n\nFirst, we were able to get the EL wire to light up but not consistently. Through trial and error, we were able to determine that the issue was the button on the pocket inverter. We had to solder a wire to keep the button continuously open.\nOnce everything was working with alligator clips holding it together, I soldered everything. Then it stopped working. Using the drill and the mulitmeter, I was able to determine that issue was in the connection between phone charger cord and the pocket inverter but have not had time to successfully trouble shoot. \n\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nThis entire project was out of my comfort zone and daunting. I am very proud to have gotten the current to work and gotten the roller to work with my bike wheel. I learned quite a bit about tools and electrical current. I'm proud of coming so close to making something practical and useful with parts that were around. I will continue to make this work.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nWhat a step motor is\nHow to use a multimeter\nWhat a transformer looks like\nThe basic concept of a transformer\nThe basic concepts of AC and DC currents\n\nWhat's next for Pedal Powered Bike Light\n\nI need to continue working with the pocket inverter. Using the multimeter, I was able to measure current up to that connection. The EL wire is still working with a regular pocket inverter so the fault is somewhere in soldering the phone charger cord to the pocket inverter. Eventually, I would like to build a weather-proof housing unit and possibly condense some of the parts.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    stepper-motorel-wireold-cell-phone-charger\n  \n\n      \n    ",

She lives in Washington DC, so we can never run against one another. I wanted a better way to compete with her other than texting our times back and forth. Brian and I built Run With Me to do just that. Run With Me provides real time information during the race, and can drive us to run harder as if we were next to each other.\n\nWhat it does\n\nNothing inspires a person more than a competition, and until now the only competition in running applications was data vs data.  You look up a run.  You do the run.  You check your standings.  No live feedback.  No real motivation to run faster.  You never run harder than when someone is there next to you.  Pushing you to the limit.  But what if your running partner isn\u2019t in the same City or timezone?  Perhaps this distance keeps you running solo?  Run With Me makes sure that there is always someone right next to you.  With Run With Me you choose a time and a distance, and then challenge someone to a virtual race.  A GPS enabled running band synchronizes you and your partners distance as you both run.  In race audio notifications let you know if you are ahead, behind or finished.  Don\u2019t always have a running partner?  Our ghost runner feature allows you to challenge a previous run performed by you or anyone in the Run With Me community.  Run like you should\u2026Run With Me.\n\nHow I built it\n\nThe system consists of: a UI written with React JS framework and Mongo DB for storage, an arduino platform with GPS and zigbee modules and python/django applications.  The ardunio platform is hardware that I had constructed for a previous project.  This includes all of the soldering and positions of the sensors on the board.  To use the application the user would run with the ardunio platform and the gps readings will be read every 4 seconds and then sent to a computer via zigbee.  Once received by the computer a python application hits a django rest service to load the readings into the database.  The React application maintains the user presentation of the race.  Positions will be periodically polled from the javascript application via the rest service to determine the progress of the race.  During the race audio updates will indicate to a user when passing or falling behind.  At the completion of the race the application resets and a new race can begin.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nThe first challenge was working with a bluetooth module.  The original plan for communication with the armband platform was to have it communicate over bluetooth to a background cell phone application that would load values into the database via the django rest service.  Despite my best efforts the bluetooth module would not work with the arduino uno platform due to a missing output pin on the bluetooth module.  Without the output pin debugging was not going to be possible while the bluetooth device was attached to the arduino, so we decided it would be best to reevaluate the approach.  I had some basic python code for Zigbee Digimesh, so instead of bluetooth to phone the armband platform sends data over zigbee to a computer.  This vastly reduced the portability of the proof of concept system.\n\nChallenges with the javascript program were mostly related to quantity of work required to get the framework and race program running.  Most of the work itself was straight forward, but it was difficult to work long hours on little sleep to complete the project. We made design decisions early on in the project that left most of the major lifting to the javascript application. A more balanced devision of the functionality between the two applications would have made it easier to isolate issues.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nSome of the design decisions that we made early on in the process led to an imbalance in the work.  By relying heavily on the javascript program to store information and execute the race itself Dan was saddled with a disproportionate amount of the work.  In the future it would be good to do a more thorough breakdown of the expected work to ensure that work can be split more easily. \nIt is important to schedule deliberate moments to evaluate progress, and rearrange development resources.    \n\nWhat's next for Run With Me\n\nWe would like to create our own arm band that allows us to add other sensors to provide runners with additional data (heart rate, breathing rate. sweat rate, etc), but we have to acknowledge that there are already many fitness bands out there.  Run With Me would benefit greatly if it could work at least in some capacity with popular fitness bands and trackers.\n\nA future iteration of the arm band running platform that we design would have to be bluetooth enabled to allow the user to pair with a phone to upload the live data into the database.  Additional sensors would be modular so they can be added to the platform with minimal effort by the user.\n\nThe UI that we have created is merely the tip of the iceberg of functionality that can be provided given the data collected.  Beyond live in race statistics Run with Me would provide historical race data analysis, custom sound recording, and both android and IOS support.  The potential for custom race views, charts and statistics leaves the design of the final application decidedly open ended.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    reactfluxpythondjangoarduinosqlitemongodbsocket.ionode.js\n  \n\n      \n    ",

I had trouble tracking down how to redirect the physical bill to my location, and was surprised to learn the city doesn't support electronic accounts or email billing at all. I'm also a lazy programmer so I wanted this automated reminder every month.\n\nWhat it does\n\nYou go to www.charmcitywaterbiller.com (yes I bought a domain yesterday just for this :) and sign up. That's it! The system will record your information and email you every time your bill is posted (monthly). You can sign up for multiple addresses with the same email if you want.\n\nHow I built it\n\nI wrote a wrapper that crawls the Baltimore City water bill website, and exposes the bill through an API tied to an AWS Lambda function. Now anyone can query the website using this API call. I wrote several other API calls using Lambda functions that do the following: /Subscribe an email to a water bill account, /Run the crawler and email all subscribers if the bill was updated. The database is stored in DynamoDB in 3 tables.  The website is run from S3.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nDynamo is still a newer service, and APIs are still a little low level. I spent too much time focusing on the CRUD aspects of emails and bill data that could have been spent on some stretch goals I had (like text notifications through Nexmo, email confirmation, unsubscribing, and pretty-ifying the email you receive)\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\n\nI built the entire project within this weekend, and it is a fully functional live website that met my MVP goals (anyone can go to the site and sign up right now)\nThe project is built and deployed every commit to master using GitLab and Terraform. What this means is I have a scalable, data-backed solution with CI and CD without spinning up a single server\nSince it's a low frequency API, it will fall under AWS' free tier and be free for me. As a bonus, it's built on js and .NET Core, so it's 100% cross platform. Check out the code on GitLab - you can see the continuous deployment pipelines as well. Please note this project and it's 36+ commits are all in the feature/local branch on GitLab. Once I move this to \"production\" I will merge to master.\n\n\nWhat I learned\n\n\nDynamoDB needs a higher level API wrapper (at least for .NET)!\nServerless development is incredibly fun. Setting up an API that has inherent ability to accept 100s of requests a second (barring your actual logic)\n\n\nWhat's next for Charm City Water Biller\n\n\nUse Nexmo and have users opt in for text notifications\nAdd confirmation and unsubscription workflows and API endpoints\nClean up some of CI/CD automation - some hacks in there to tie things together\nAdd better formatting to the email\nClean up deployment for \"production\" - some hand rolled things can easily be removed\nOffer some data analysis - after all this records every account every month. There are a lot of interesting options here - one that comes to mind is mapping the highest \"delinquent\" accounts by neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    amazon-dynamodbamazon-lambdagitlabterraformc#\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  www.charmcitywaterbiller.com\n\n        \n  \n  gitlab.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

It is a form intake portal and processing system that employees can use to submit professional development training requests, perform reviews and approvals, track status and initiate the procurement process for trainings or professional development in a way that is paperless and reportable.\n\nInspiration\n\nThe agency has a number of paper-based processes that are entirely inefficient.  The training request is an example, and is the subject of this prototype.  Employees routinely make time-sensitive requests for professional development, but employees, supervisors, and agency directors have no information about the overall performance of the process and therefore are unable to measure or improve it. Today, this request involves 4 to 5 people handing off a single piece of paper for signatures.  The process is not standardized and can take anywhere from 2 days for approval to 2 months if the paper is lost or hidden in a pile on someone's desk.   The move to an electronic system will allow us to use data from individual events to manage the process to bring predictability, tracking, reporting, and allow us to use this information to do the following:\n\n\nuse historical data about the type of training requests to inform our HR department about the patterns in training needs by division to take planning action\nuse historical data about dollar values of training request by division and by activity to more accurately inform the budget projections and budget development process for each fiscal year\nuse this data to identify instances in which multiple staff people across different divisions who don't know each other request the same type of training that could be purchased for a cheaper price if we are aware of these request and can coordinate and get a better deal. \nuse the data to develop tack time standards for process actors \nuse this data to answer questions we cannot today about who has what training needs and what is the volume annually and how do training requests match up with (or not) the direction HR and the director want to move the organization in terms of human capital development.\n\n\nWhat it does\n\n\nAllow users to submit a training request. \nAllow users to see their submissions, and the status of those submissions\nAllow supervisors to review training requests. \nAllow users to see their requests for professional development as well as the forms they are required to act on that were submitted by their direct reports.\nIt provides high level summary information for each user on all professional development requests\n\n\nHow we built it\n\n\nJavaScript\nNode & NPM\nExpress\nMongodb\nWebpack\nWebpack Dev Server\nReact\nReact Router\nBabel\nGriddle React\nReact Bootstrap\n\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nOne of Brian's personal development goals was to build something using \"bare\" technologies.  There are many out of the box solutions and starter kits for using a particular technology stack, especially related to React, but I feel that when I use those things, I am only working toward the goal, rather than enriching my own knowledge of how the base technologies work.  I used all of the technologies listed above in their \"natural\" state, and did not rely on the 3rd party libraries to manage them.  About a third of my time was spent learning how to use the technologies I wasn't already familiar with on their own.  This was challenging for me because I essentially only had 24 hours to implement a prototype, and I was stressing out trying to learn these familiar technologies on their own.\n\nWe did not have enough time to implement all of the base functionality we originally intended.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nBrian built some awesome shit in an extremely short period of time!  In less than 48 hours of work I can see the beginnings of a solution that can fix a problem my agency has faced for years.  It is a problem many agencies have.   I am also proud that it will be openly available to other municipal employees that have similar challenges with small paper form processes that are used often. \n\nI think we were able to accomplish as much as we did in 24 hours as a result of employing the concepts of data-driven development (among other things, such as great communication between us).  Step One was understanding the requirements, modeling the data, then building out all data structures before any other development was done.  These well thought-out data structures proved to be invaluable for rapid prototyping and \"natural\" feeling flows in the code.\n\nI am also proud of building a working prototype using from scratch using the above technology stack.  This increases my understanding of how these technologies work as well as reducing dependencies and overhead.\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nHow to think about structuring data you will use to inform how you build an application. \nHow to think about capturing records and properties of a record more easily in Mongodb. \nSyntax and more efficient ways for using if statements. \nHow to build a web application with the selected technology stack from scratch\n\n\nWhat's next for Agency Portal\n\n\nBetter code structure\nBetter use of the existing libraries\nDeveloping notifications to task actors based on submission and failure to complete tasks within set timeframes. \nAllowing supervisors to approve or reject and for requestors to be informed of the action and reasons. \nAllowing purchasers to perform approval task after supervisor approval.\nAllowing for uploading attachments with submissions so that a supervisor has all information necessary for review and purchaser has all information needed for payment.\nField test...?\n\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    javascriptnode.jsmongodbreactbootstrap\n  \n\n        \n    Try it out\n\n    \n        \n  \n  github.com\n\n    \n  \n\n    ",

My company 'Kariz Kids Youth Enrichment Services' have been serving youth in the community since 2011. The purpose of our youth program is to teach kids about the fundamentals of the music business incorporating financial literacy and music production. After 6+ years of teaching this curriculum in schools, we recently began facing challenges in funding. This challenge is a refection of City Schools and organizations falling victim to city budget cuts resulting in the lack of creative outlets for youth. This Application would make our services become more affordable and accessible  by schools thus exposing this platform to more youth and encouraging them to be creative while polishing math skills, and vocabulary. \n\nHow Does It Work?\nTheres a Digital Audio Workstation Interface. \nUser answers math questions. Each question is worth a certain amount of credit (money). \nThis credit is used to purchased instruments and sounds.\nThese sounds are in loop form. After the word problem is answered correctly, money deposits into the users account.\nThese funds are used to purchase a maximum of 8 different audio tracks and one empty audio track to record vocals. The goal is to answer enough Math questions correct in order to complete the recording of a song.\n\nThe Progress:\n\nTeam Abilities:\nKariz: Music Producer / Youth Educator/ Founder of Kariz Kids Youth Enrichment Services. \nDrew: web developer bootcamp grad Javascript / JQuery  / HTML / CSS\nAllen: Javascript / JQuery  / HTML / CSS\n\nHow I built it\n\nHow was it Built: We built a web app using the HTML5 web audio API to play audio, update the DOM, and record audio. We pulled in the Buzz JS library to merge two audio files in the browser, allowing the user to record an audio track on top of our prerecorded audio.\n\nWhat's next for Math+Music=Money\n\nWhats Next?\nUltimately we would like to have several different tempo's, loop's and instruments to choose from. There will be an export option for the final song. There will also be an option that will give listeners an opportunity to purchase the song. All proceeds go directly to the user (the youth that created the song). \n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    javascriptjquerycss3html5\n  \n\n      \n    ",

We wanted to also provide a resource for undocumented immigrants related to ICE and other immigration officials. \n\nWhat it does\n\nCCC Watch provides a hub of mapping resources for police accountability and personal safety. It lists a person's rights when dealing with the police. The main functionality comes from the three maps. We have a resource map that integrates Google Maps to help inform people of law and harm reduction organizations in the area. We have an Incident Map that uses an Ushahidi deployment to allow users to dynamically map and report incidents as well as include a right-up, images, and video describing it. Finally, the story map allows users to create a crowdsourced oral history of Baltimore, similar to the Ushahidi deployment, but more general in scope for any stories users want to tell.\n\nHow we built it\n\nWe used SquareSpace and HTML5+CSS to get a site off the ground. Sourcing various copwatch orgs, we created a page of rights relating to arrests. Then, using GIS and GoogleMaps, we used JavaScript to create the resource map. Ushahidi provided a platform for us to create a crowdsourced map deployment. Finally the story map is similar in function to the Ushahidi deployment, using StoryMapJS.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nGIS broke a lot. Initially this project started as an app, but Android Studio was a disaster (we also had no prior experience with app building)\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nThe visual design of the website and our Google Maps integration! The site is also intentionally bare bones, so that it can be easily accessed even when internet is limited.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nProbably don't set out to create an app when neither of you has experience, the program keeps crashing, and you only have 24 hours.\n\nWhat's next for CCC Watch\n\nExpand the Ushahidi deployment. Embed all the maps into the site so that every component is centralized. Maybe actually develop the app. Work out registration/privacy features.

        "description": "\n      \n\n\n\n      \n  Inspiration\n\nI noticed that on Reddit, there are some subreddits that are filled with good stories. You probably don't want to miss any of these, and I thought about how to make the average Reddit user be up to date on their subs. Thus, RedditSMS was born.\n\nWhat it does\n\nThis web app has two parts:\n\nThe first, is a web based realtime feed. You can enter the subreddit you want to monitor in the text box and then click the button to change the active sub.\n\nThe second is in the SMS tab in the nav bar. It takes your phone number and subreddit you want to subscribe to and texts you twice when a new post is added to the subreddit, the first letting you know that a new post is there, and the second supplying a link to that post. \n\nHow I built it\n\nI built the entire front end over the weekend using HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap and CSS. For the server side, I had a friend build it for me.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nThe first couple of challenges were implementing the API, and making sure everything worked, then formatting to page so everything looks right, and then implementing the ruby web server.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nThat the best things take time. It took me 2 years to learn everything for this app to work right, and I'm proud of myself.\n\nWhat's next for RedditSMS\n\nGluing the front end and the back end together, because they aren't right now.\n\nWhere to demo\n\nGo to redditsms.tk!\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    rubyrubygemshtml5cssjavascriptjquerybootstrap\n  \n\n      \n    ",

It's fun, and satisfies the human drive to conduct music.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nEach of us learned different skills; Chris solved the cross-platform and speed/pitch issues above. Margie delved into the Leap Motion API and \"branding.\" Kathleen got to wade into WebGL and three.js\n\nWhat's next for The Music Thing\n\nMaybe someone can start a band with it....

Did you bring back your wand and then everyone ooed and awed about it. Right? Well, We wanted to do this with History. The inspiration for this project came from my volunteer experience with the Ft McHenry Jr. fife and drum corp at the Star Bangled Banner Spectacular a few years ago.  During my time there, I loved the being part of the history and making history come alive for the visitors. Unfortunately, that was not always possible, since most of the special events only happen on the weekend or during holidays. You can see the actual historical location but that is it. The plaques truthfully are not really that enticing to visitors. Bella and I wanted to take that experience and allow the visiting families to have a fun time even when there may not be live reenactors present. We wanted to highlight the best part of the park, plus reinforce the idea of why this particular park was chosen to be a monument or a National park. We wanted to make the everyday history magical and powerful as well as a neat experience that people wanted to take back home with and share all that they learned about with their friends and family in an amazing way.  So we bring you the exciting world of History Flip! Where we literally flip how you experience and learn about history. \n\nWhat it does\n\nHistory Flip is a physical souvenir with a \"magical\" twist! Users can buy this at the visitor center at a historical site or museum. Once they get the figure there is a hidden feature to be discovered on the flipside. Our model is of Ft. McHenry, Star Bangled Banner edition. Once you buy it, you can download the History Flip app and explore the world of Augmented Reality of 1812. The History Flip presents to the user with the historical facts and games to enhance the experience.\n\nHow we built it\n\nClaire: I took care of the hardware side of things and created the physical figure that people see. I used 123D Design to create the 3D printed model of the fort. I used Inkscape to create the picture on the bottom that later got laser cut. I found and configured the flag animation from the Unity Asset Store and prepared it for use in our app.\n\nBella: Originally, I planned to make an Android app with Android Studio and use Open CV (computer vision) for image recognition. I'd never used Android Studio before, though, and after hours of struggling, I decided to try to use Unity instead. I implemented Vuforia, an augmented reality platform, with Unity to build an Android app from scratch.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    android-studiounityvuforia3dprintinglasercuttingaugmented-realityinkscape123ddesign\n  \n\n      \n    ",

Animated gifs are a popular type of content to share and are found all over the internet. Many gifs share a short video clip of a hilarious or interesting moment.\n\nWhat it does\n\nSimply copy your favorite gifs to the SD card, and turn it on! The Pi TV will play each animated gif in an endless slideshow fashion for hours of entertainment!\n\nHow I built it\n\nA Raspberry Pi drives a small touch LCD screen via the SPI interface. The Raspberry Pi reads gif files found on the SD card, and plays them in full screen mode in an endless slideshow. Mplayer was used for displaying the gif files. A custom 3D enclosure was printed to protect the device. It resembles an old fashioned TV with antenna, and the bright colors make it fun to look at.   \n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nDesigning my first 3D model for printing. I had to learn how to use Tinkercad for my 2-piece enclosure. Multiple print attempts had to be done to get it right. Also displaying the gifs in a clean way was difficult. I had to find the right video player that could display an animated gif, full screen, scale images, and could perform well even on the Raspberry Pi's limited performance.  \n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nIt works! I learned how to use 3D modeling software and use a 3D printer.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nI learned how to use 3D modeling software and how challenging it is. I also learned how to use a 3D printer and the limitations that come with it. I learned how to use an LCD screen with my Raspberry pi.\n\nWhat's next for Pi Tv\n\nMake use of the \"touch\" part of my LCD touch-screen. It could be used to skip the current image or apply an interesting filter to the current image. \nI could also use the wifi module to download new images in the background. Images would be downloaded and cached on the SD card for better performance.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    raspberry-pilcd3dprintinglinuxwifi\n  \n\n      \n    ",

The goal is to make life easier and more comfortable for anyone with an Apple TV.\n\nWhat it does\n\nHomeLife is a beautiful home dashboard for your Apple TV where people can get a quick overview of their day, and easily control their homes. It gives users a quick glance at their day, showing items such as upcoming weather or calendar events in a timeline view. These timeline views pull historical and future events from various data sources, and then display it intuitively. Users can also get quick access to their smart home via mood buttons. The mood widget interacts with SmartThings to quickly set the right mood in your home. It can adjust lights, music, locks and more to just the right settings. Switch into away mode when you\u2019re on the way out, and it can turn off all lights. Switch into romance mood to dim the lights and play some Marvin Gaye. All of this works already in our prototype. Eventually, users would be able to add, delete, and rearrange their widgets to make it feel just right in their home.\n\nHow I built it\n\nTo build HomeLife, we started off with a top level design split into two sections. One for time based information, like weather, calendar events and security cameras, and the other for quick access to the things that we like to do often, such as controlling our music and setting the mood in our smart homes. Both of these sections would eventually have a large selection of potential \u201cwidgets\u201d, so that every HomeLife is perfectly customized for it\u2019s users. In the timeline, we have so far implemented weather, which pulls real data from the web and draws a nice line chart, and a camera module which shows a live feed as well as snapshots for the past. In the quick access section, we\u2019ve integrated with SmartThings to enable setting modes in the smart home, allowing users to control lights, music, locks, and more.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nWe ran into several challenges during this work. Anthony had not used Swift in a project before this work, but decided to take this chance to learn and become more comfortable with it. Both of us are new to developing on the Apple TV, so we had to learn about the new user interface elements and some differences from other iOS development. Integrating with SmartThings added another level of complexity. This required writing SmartApps to run in the SmartThings cloud to which HomeLife sends commands and requests. It took some extra effort to make sure all communication happened as expected. The other major issue that we have run into this morning is that the API we were depending on for weather data is now failing when we request the historical temperatures. We tried to work around this last minute, but were unable to come up with a solution in time.\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nWe are proud of the high-level design that we built. This design will allow us to easily add new widgets in the future with minimal changes to the existing programming. Creating a strong infrastructure will allow us to concentrate more on making additional widgets and on making them beautiful.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nBoth of us gained experience in developing on the Apple TV. Brice learned good practices in design and implementation from Anthony\u2019s professional experience. Anthony gained a lot of experience in Swift and is looking forward to using it more in the future.\n\nWhat's next for TV Dashboard\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to work on HomeLife. First, we will have to do some clean up on the last-minute rushed parts of the existing code. After that, we have several ideas for additional useful widgets to expand on this initial idea. When it\u2019s ready, we may pursue sale of HomeLife on the App Store.\n\nHomeLife was built with Swift in Xcode. The interface for SmartThings was built in Groovy.\n\n\n\n        \n    Built With\n\n    swifttvos\n  \n\n      \n    ",
